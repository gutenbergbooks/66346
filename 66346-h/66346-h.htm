<h1 title=""><i>The Lighter Classics in Music</i></h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Joseph <b id="g_Achron">Achron</b></span></h2>
<p>Joseph Achron was born in Lozdzieje, Lithuania, on May
13, 1886. He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied
the violin with Leopold Auer and theory with Anatol Liadov,
graduating in 1904. After teaching at the Kharkov Conservatory for
three years, he toured Russia, Europe and the Near East as a concert
violinist for about six years, and settled permanently in the United
States in 1925. Some of his most ambitious and significant compositions
were written in this country. Among these were three violin concertos,
two violin sonatas, the <i>Golem Suite</i> for orchestra and the <i>Stempenyu
Suite</i> for violin and piano. Achron died in Hollywood, California, on
April 29, 1943.</p>
<p>When Achron was twenty-five years old, and still living in Russia, he
became a member of the music committee of the Hebrew Folk Music
Society of St. Petersburg. Its aim was twofold: to encourage research in
Hebrew music, and to direct the enthusiasm of gifted Russian composers
toward the writing of Hebrew music. It was as a direct result of this association,
and the stimulus derived from the achievements of this society,
that in 1911 Achron wrote a popular composition in a Hebraic vein
which to this day is his most famous piece of music. It is the <i>Hebrew
Melody</i>, Op. 33, for violin and orchestra. The melodic germ of this composition
is an actual synagogical chant, amplified by Achron into a spacious
melody following several introductory measures of descending,
brooding phrases. This melody is first given in a lower register, but when
repeated several octaves higher it receives embellishments similar to
those provided a synagogical chant by a cantor. The composition ends
with the same descending minor-key phrases with which it opened. This
<i>Hebrew Melody</i>, in a transcription for violin and piano by Leopold
Auer, has been performed by many of the world&rsquo;s leading violin virtuosos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Adolphe-Charles <b id="g_Adam">Adam</b></span></h2>
<p>Adolphe-Charles Adam, eminent composer of comic
operas, was born in Paris on July 24, 1803. He attended the Paris Conservatory,
where he came under the decisive influence of Fran&ccedil;ois Boieldieu,
under whose guidance he completed his first comic opera, <i>Pierre
et Catherine</i>, first produced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in Paris on February
9, 1829. His first major success, <i>Le Chalet</i>, was given on September 25,
1834, enjoying almost fifteen hundred performances in Paris before the
end of the century. Adam subsequently wrote almost fifty other stage
works in a light style. With Boieldieu and Auber he became founder
and leading exponent of the op&eacute;ra-comique. His most celebrated work
in this genre was <i>Le Postillon de Longjumeau</i>, first given at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique
on October 13, 1836. This work was frequently heard in the
United States in the 1860&rsquo;s and 1870&rsquo;s, but has since lapsed into obscurity.
Adam was also a highly significant composer of ballets, of which
<i>Giselle</i> is now a classic; of many serious operas; and of a celebrated
Christmas song, &ldquo;No&euml;l,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh, Holy Night&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Cantique de No&euml;l:
Minuit, Chr&eacute;tiens</i>&rdquo;), which has been transcribed for orchestra. In 1847,
Adam founded his own theater&mdash;the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre National&mdash;which a year
later (with the outbreak of the 1848 revolution in France) went into
bankruptcy. From 1849 on he was professor of composition at the Paris
Conservatory. Adam died in Paris on May 3, 1856.</p>
<p><i>Giselle</i> is one of the proudest achievements of French Romantic ballet.
Through the years it has never lost its immense popularity. With
choreography by Jules Perrot and Jean Coralli, it was introduced in
Paris on June 28, 1841. Carlotta Grisi appeared in the title role. <i>Giselle</i>
was an immediate triumph. Since then, the world&rsquo;s foremost ballerinas
have appeared as Giselle, including Fanny Elssler, Taglioni, Pavlova,
Karsavina, Markova, Danilova, Margot Fonteyn, and Moira Shearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the secret charm of this ballet?&rdquo; inquires the famous scenic
designer, Alexander Benois. He goes on to answer: &ldquo;It is mainly due to
its simplicity and clearness of plot, to the amazingly impetuous spontaneity
with which the drama is developed. There is barely time to collect
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
one&rsquo;s thoughts before the heroine, who but a moment ago charmed
everybody with her vitality, is lying stiff and cold and dead at the feet of
the lover who deceived her.... It is deeply moving, and the magic of
a true poet ... consists in making us accept without question any
absurdities he may choose to offer us.... No one is inclined to criticize
while under the spell of this strange idyl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ballet text was the collaborative creation of Th&eacute;ophile Gautier,
Vernoy de Saint-Georges, and Jean Coralli. Gautier had read a legend
by Heinrich Heine in <i>De L&rsquo;Allemagne</i> which described elves in white
dresses (designated as &ldquo;wilis&rdquo;) who died before their wedding day and
emerged from their graves in bridal dress to dance till dawn. Any man
an elf met was doomed to dance himself to death. Gautier, recognizing
the ballet potentialities of this legend, decided to adapt it for Carlotta
Grisi. He interested Vernoy de Saint-Georges in assisting him in making
this ballet adaptation and Jean Coralli in creating some of the dance
sequences. &ldquo;Three days later,&rdquo; Gautier revealed in a letter to Heine,
&ldquo;the ballet <i>Giselle</i> was accepted. By the end of the week, Adam had improvised
the music, the scenery was nearly ready, and the rehearsals
were in full swing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ballet text finds Giselle as a sweet, carefree peasant girl. Betrayed
by Albrecht, the Duke of Silesia, she goes mad and commits suicide. Her
grave is touched by the magic branch of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis.
Giselle arises from the grave as a wili, and performs her nocturnal dance.
Albrecht, who comes to visit her grave, is caught up by her spell and must
dance to his doom.</p>
<p>A master of expressive and dramatized melodies, Adam here created
a score filled with the most ingratiating tunes and spirited rhythms, all
beautifully adjusted to the sensitive moods of this delicate fantasy. From
this score the 20th-century English composer Constant Lambert extracted
four melodic episodes which he made into a popular orchestral
suite: &ldquo;Giselle&rsquo;s Dance&rdquo;; &ldquo;Mad Scene&rdquo;; &ldquo;Pas de deux, Act 2&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Closing
Scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the repertory of Adam&rsquo;s operas comes a delightful overture, a
favorite in the semi-classical repertory, even though the opera itself is
rarely heard. It is the Overture to <i>If I Were King</i> (<i>Si j&rsquo;&eacute;tais roi</i>). This
comic opera was first performed in Paris on November 4, 1852; the
libretto was by D&rsquo;Ennery and Br&eacute;sil. In Arabia, the fisherman, Zephoris,
has managed to save the life of Nemea, beautiful daughter of King
Oman. But Nemea is being pursued by Prince Kador, who does not
hesitate to employ treachery to win her. Nemea is determined to marry
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
none but the unidentified man who had saved her life. Eventually, the
fisherman is brought to the palace, placed in command of the troops,
and becomes a hero in a war against the Spaniards. Kador is sent to his
disgrace, and Zephoris wins the hand of Nemea.</p>
<p>The oriental background of the opera permeates the atmosphere of
the overture. A forceful introduction for full orchestra and arpeggio
figures in harp lead to a skipping and delicate tune for first violins
against plucked cello strings. The flutes and clarinets respond with a
subsidiary thought. A crescendo brings on a strong subject for the
violins against a loud accompaniment. After a change of tempo, another
light, graceful melody is given by solo flute and oboes. The principal
melodic material is then amplified with dramatic effect.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Richard <b id="g_Addinsell">Addinsell</b></span></h2>
<p>Richard Addinsell was born in Oxford, England, on
January 13, 1904. After studying law at Oxford, he attended the Royal
College of Music in London and completed his music study in Berlin
and Vienna between 1929 and 1932. In 1933 he visited the United
States, where he wrote music for several Hollywood films and for a New
York stage production of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. He has since made a
specialty of writing music for the screen, his best efforts being the scores
for <i>Goodbye, Mr. Chips</i>, <i>Blithe Spirit</i>, <i>Dangerous Moonlight</i>, <i>Dark
Journey</i>, and <i>Fire Over England</i>. During World War II he wrote music
for several documentary films, including <i>Siege of Tobruk</i> and <i>We Sail
at Midnight</i>.</p>
<p>Addinsell&rsquo;s most frequently played composition is the <i>Warsaw Concerto</i>,
for piano and orchestra. He wrote it for the English movie
<i>Dangerous Moonlight</i> (renamed in the United States <i>Suicide Squadron</i>).
Anton Walbrook here plays the part of a renowned concert pianist
who becomes an officer in the Polish air force during World War II and
loses his memory after a crash. The <i>Warsaw Concerto</i>, basic to the plot
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
structure, recurs several times in the film. It first became popular, however,
on records, and after that with &ldquo;pop&rdquo; and salon orchestras.
Though the composer&rsquo;s indebtedness to Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s Second Piano
Concerto is pronounced, the <i>Warsaw Concerto</i> has enough of its own
individuality and charm to survive. Structurally, it is not a concerto but
a rhapsody. It opens with several massive chords, arpeggios, and scale
passages in the piano. This dramatic opening leads to the sensitive and
romantic principal melody, heard in the strings. Later on there appears
a second lyric thought, but the rhapsodic character remains predominant.
The composition ends with a final statement of the opening
phrase of the first main melody.</p>
<p>Addinsell is also sometimes represented on semi-classical programs
with a light-textured and tuneful composition called <i>Prelude and Waltz</i>,
for orchestra. This also stems from a motion picture, in this case the
British screen adaptation of Noel Coward&rsquo;s <i>Blithe Spirit</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Isaac <b id="g_Albeniz">Alb&eacute;niz</b></span></h2>
<p>Isaac Alb&eacute;niz, one of Spain&rsquo;s most distinguished composers,
was born in Camprod&oacute;n, Spain, on May 29, 1860. He was a child prodigy
who gave piano concerts in Spain after some spasmodic study in
Paris with Marmontel. In 1868 he entered the Madrid Conservatory,
but in his thirteenth year he ran away from home and spent several
years traveling about in Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the United States, supporting
himself all the while by playing the piano. He was back in
Spain in 1875, and soon thereafter undertook music study seriously,
first at the Brussels Conservatory and then at the Leipzig Conservatory.
He settled in Paris in 1893, where he wrote his first important works,
one of these being his first composition in a national Spanish idiom: the
<i>Catalonia</i>, for piano and orchestra, in 1899. After 1900 he lived in his
native land. From 1906 to 1909 he devoted himself to the writing of his
masterwork, the suite <i>Iberia</i>, consisting of twelve pieces for the piano
gathered in four volumes. <i>Iberia</i> is a vast tonal panorama of Spain, its

sights and sounds, dances and songs, backgrounds. Alb&eacute;niz died in
Cambo-Bains, in the Pyrenees, on May 18, 1909.</p>
<p>Alb&eacute;niz may well be regarded as the founder of the modern Spanish
nationalist school in music. This school sought to exploit the rhythms
and melodies and styles of Spanish folk music within serious concert
works, thus providing a musical interpretation to every possible aspect
of Spanish life.</p>
<p>Alb&eacute;niz&rsquo; first work in the national style is also one of his rare compositions
utilizing an orchestra. It is the <i>Catalonia</i>, written in 1899, and
introduced that year at a concert of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de musique in
Paris. This work is sometimes erroneously designated as a suite, but it
is actually a one-movement rhapsody. A single theme, unmistakably
Spanish, dominates the entire work. A brief rhythmic middle section
for wind, percussion, and a single double bass provides contrast. This
middle part is intended as a burlesque on a troupe of wandering musicians
playing their favorite tune: the clarinet plays off key and the bass
drum is off beat. The original dance melody returns to conclude the
work.</p>
<p><i>C&oacute;rdoba</i>, a haunting nocturne, is the fourth and most famous number
from the <i>Cantos de Espa&ntilde;a</i>, a suite for the piano, op. 232. <i>C&oacute;rdoba</i>
is a vivid tone picture of that famous Andalusian city. Sharp chords,
as if plucked from the strings of a guitar, preface an oriental-type
melody which suggests the Moorish background of the city.</p>
<p><i>F&ecirc;te Dieu &agrave; Seville</i>, or <i>El Corpus en Sevilla</i> (<i>Festival in Seville</i>) is the
third and concluding number from the first volume of <i>Iberia</i>. Besides
its original version for the piano, this composition is celebrated in several
transcriptions for orchestra, notably those by E. Fern&aacute;ndez Arb&oacute;s
and Leopold Stokowski. This music depicts a religious procession in
the streets of Seville on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. At the head
of the procession is the priest bearing the Host, or Blessed Sacrament,
under a lavishly decorated canopy. As the procession moves, worshipers
who crowd the streets improvise a religious chant.</p>
<p><i>F&ecirc;te Dieu &agrave; Seville</i> opens with a brusquely accented march melody,
against which emerges an improvisational-type melody similar to those
sung by worshipers in the street. The march melody and the improvised
chant alternate, but it is the chant that is carried to a thunderous
climax. Then this chant subsides and fades away into the distance, as
the composition ends.</p>
<p><i>Navarra</i> is a poignant tonal evocation for piano of the Spanish province
below the Pyrenees. Alb&eacute;niz never completed this work; it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
finished after his death by D&eacute;odat de S&eacute;verac. This composition is perhaps
best known in Fern&aacute;ndez Arb&oacute;s&rsquo; transcription for orchestra.
Against the provocative background of a jota rhythm moves a languorous
and sensual gypsy melody.</p>
<p><i>Sevilla&ntilde;as</i> (<i>Seville</i>) is the third number from <i>Suite espa&ntilde;ola</i> for piano;
it has become famous independent of the larger work and is often heard
in transcription. The heart of the piece is a passionate song, typical of
those heard in the haunts of Seville. As a background there is an incisive
rhythm suggesting the clicking of castanets.</p>
<p>The Tango in D major, op. 165, no. 2, for piano, is not only the most
famous one by Alb&eacute;niz but one of the most popular ever written. With
its intriguing flamenco-like melody and compelling rhythm it is Spanish
to the core&mdash;the prototype of all tango music. The original piano
version as written by the composer is not often heard. When it is performed
on the piano, this tango is given in a brilliant but complex
arrangement by Leopold Godowsky. But it is much more famous in
various transcriptions, notably one for violin and piano by Fritz Kreisler,
and numerous ones for small or large orchestras.</p>
<p><i>Triana</i> is the third and concluding number from the second book of
Alb&eacute;niz&rsquo; monumental suite for piano, <i>Iberia</i>. Triana, of which this
music is a tonal picture, is a gypsy suburb of Seville. In the introduction,
random phrases bring up the image of various attitudes and movements
of Spanish dances. A triple-rhythmed figure leads to a light and
graceful dance melody against a bolero rhythm. As the melody is developed
and repeated it gains in intensity and is enriched in color until
it evolves climactically with full force. A transcription for orchestra by
Fern&aacute;ndez Arb&oacute;s is as famous as the original piano version.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Hugo <b id="g_Alfven">Alfv&eacute;n</b></span></h2>
<p>Hugo Alfv&eacute;n was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 1,
1872. His music study took place at the Stockholm Conservatory and,
on government stipends, with C&eacute;sar Thomson in Brussels, and in Germany
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and France. From 1910 to 1939 he was musical director and conductor
of the student chorus at the Uppsala University. Alfv&eacute;n was a
nationalist composer of Romantic tendencies who wrote five symphonies
together with a considerable amount of orchestral and choral
music. He died in Faluns, Sweden, on May 8, 1960.</p>
<p><i>Midsummer Vigil</i> (<i>Midsommarvaka</i>), op. 19 (1904), a Swedish rhapsody
for orchestra, is his best known composition. It was produced as a
ballet, <i>La Nuit de Saint-Jean</i>, in Paris on October 25, 1925, where it
proved so successful that it was given more than 250 performances within
four years. As a work for symphony orchestra it has received universal
acclaim for its attractive deployment of national Swedish folk song
idioms and dance rhythms. The music describes a revel held in small
Swedish towns during the St. John&rsquo;s Eve festival. The work opens with
a gay tune for clarinet over plucked strings. This is followed by a burlesque
subject for bassoon. Muted strings and English horns then offer
a broad, stately, and emotional folk song. Repeated by the French
horns, this song is soon amplified by the strings. The tempo now
quickens, and a rustic dance theme is given softly by the violins. The
mood gradually becomes frenetic. The violins offer a passionate subject
over a pedal point. A climax is finally reached as the revelry becomes
unconfined.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Louis <b id="g_Alter">Alter</b></span></h2>
<p>Louis Alter was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on June
18, 1902, where he received his academic education in the public
schools, and his initial instruction in music. Music study was completed
with Stuart Mason at the New England Conservatory. In 1924 Alter
came to New York, where for five years he worked as accompanist for
Nora Bayes, Irene Bordoni and other stars of the stage; he also did
arrangements for a publishing firm in Tin Pan Alley. Between 1925
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and 1927 he wrote his first popular songs and contributed a few of them
to Broadway productions. Since then he has written many song hits, as
well as scores for Broadway musicals and Hollywood films. His best
known songs include &ldquo;A Melody from the Sky&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dolores,&rdquo; both of
which were nominated for Academy Awards; also &ldquo;Twilight on the
Trail,&rdquo; such a favorite of President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the
manuscript, together with a recording by Bing Crosby, repose in the
Roosevelt Museum in Hyde Park, New York.</p>
<p>Alter has been successful in writing skilful compositions for piano
and orchestra in which the popular element is pronounced, encased
within a symphonic structure. Some of them are now staples in the
symphonic-jazz repertory. His best compositions were inspired by the
sights, sounds and moods of New York City.</p>
<p><i>Jewels from Cartier</i> (1953), as the title indicates, was inspired not by
New York but by one of the city&rsquo;s most famous jewelers when Alter was
one day allowed to inspect its collection. In his suite, Alter attempts in
eight sections to translate various jewels into tones. The first movement
is &ldquo;Emerald Eyes.&rdquo; Since many beautiful emeralds come from South
America, this section emphasizes the rumba beat and other Latin-American
rhythms. &ldquo;The Ruby and the Rose&rdquo; is a romantic ballad in
which voices supplement the instruments of the orchestra. &ldquo;Pearl of
the Orient&rdquo; consists of an oriental dance. &ldquo;Black Pearl of Tahiti&rdquo; exploits
exotic Polynesian rhythms and its languorous-type melodies.
&ldquo;Diamond Earrings&rdquo; is a swirling waltz while &ldquo;Star Sapphire&rdquo; is a
beguine. In &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s Eye in the Night,&rdquo; the music suggests a playful kitten
darting about in a room. The finale, &ldquo;Lady of Jade,&rdquo; is in the style of
Chinese processional music.</p>
<p><i>Manhattan Masquerade</i> (1932) is the most dramatic of Alter&rsquo;s New
York murals. It consists of a Viennese-type waltz played in fox-trot time,
a suggestion on the part of the composer that Vienna and New York are
not too far apart spiritually.</p>
<p><i>Manhattan Moonlight</i> (1932) is, on the other hand, atmospheric. It
opens with four chords in a nebulous Debussy vein. The core of the
work is an extended melody for strings against piano embellishments.
A light and frivolous mood is then invoked before the main melody
returns in an opulent scoring.</p>
<p><i>Manhattan Serenade</i> (1928) is the most famous of all Alter&rsquo;s instrumental
works and the one that first made him known. He published it
first as a piano solo, but soon rewrote it for piano and orchestra. Paul
Whiteman and his orchestra made it popular in 1929 on records and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
public concerts. This work is extremely effective in laying bare the
nerves of the metropolis through syncopations, and jazz tone colorations.
Its main melody is a plangent song to which, in 1940, Howard
Johnson adapted a song lyric. <i>Manhattan Serenade</i> is often heard as
background music on radio and television programs about New York.</p>
<p><i>Side Street in Gotham</i> (1938) attempts to portray the city from river
to river. The composition begins with a few notes suggesting &ldquo;London
Bridge Is Falling Down,&rdquo; which is later elaborated in a vigorous and
amusing tempo; the reason this theme is here used is because it is
referred to in the lyric of &ldquo;The Sidewalks of New York.&rdquo; Some of the
mystery of New York&rsquo;s side streets can also be found in this music.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Leroy <b id="g_Anderson">Anderson</b></span></h2>
<p>Leroy Anderson is one of America&rsquo;s most successful and
best known composers of light orchestral classics. He was born in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, on June 29, 1908. His early musical training took
place at the New England Conservatory, after which he studied the
bass and organ with private teachers. In 1929 he was graduated from
Harvard <i>magna cum laude</i>, and one year after that he received there his
Master&rsquo;s degree in music on a Naumberg Fellowship. For the next few
years he served as organist and choirmaster in Milton, Massachusetts;
as a member of the music faculty at Radcliffe College; and as director
of the Harvard University Band. In 1935 he became a free-lance conductor,
composer and arranger in Boston and New York. As orchestrator
for the Boston Pops Orchestra, for which he made many orchestral
arrangements over a period of several years, Anderson completed his
first original semi-classical composition, <i>Jazz Pizzicato</i>, successfully introduced
by the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1939. Since then the Boston
Pops Orchestra has introduced most of Anderson&rsquo;s compositions, many
of which proved exceptionally popular in concerts throughout the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
country and on records. Anderson has also appeared frequently as guest
conductor of important American symphony orchestras and has conducted
his own compositions with his orchestra for records. In 1958, his
first musical comedy, <i>Goldilocks</i>, was produced on Broadway.</p>
<p>Beyond possessing a most ingratiating lyric invention and a consummate
command of orchestration, Anderson boasts an irresistible
sense of humor and a fine flair for burlesque. He is probably at his best
in programmatic pieces in which extra-musical sounds are neatly
adapted to and often serve as a background for his sprightly tunes&mdash;ranging
from the clicking of a typewriter to the meowing of a cat.</p>
<p><i>Blue Tango</i> is the first strictly instrumental composition ever to
achieve first place on the Hit Parade. For almost a year it was the leading
favorite on juke boxes, and its sale of over two million records
represents Anderson&rsquo;s healthiest commercial success. Scored for violins,
this music neatly combines an insistent tango rhythm with a sensual
melody in a purple mood. <i>Bugler&rsquo;s Holiday</i> is a musical frolic for three
trumpets. <i>A Christmas Festival</i> provides a colorful orchestral setting to
some of the best loved Christmas hymns, including &ldquo;Joy to the World,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Deck the Halls,&rdquo; &ldquo;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silent Night,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jingle Bells,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Come All Ye Faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Fiddle-Faddle</i> is a merry burlesque-escapade for the violins, inspired
from a hearing of Paganini&rsquo;s <i>Perpetual Motion</i>; this, then, is a modern
style &ldquo;Perpetual Motion.&rdquo; In <i>Horse and Buggy</i>, the music nostalgically
evokes a bygone day with a sprightly, wholesome tune presented against
the rhythms of a jogging horse. The <i>Irish Suite</i> was commissioned by
the Eire Society of Boston, and is a six-movement adaptation of six of
Thomas Moore&rsquo;s <i>Irish Melodies</i>. They are: &ldquo;The Irish Washerwoman,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Minstrel Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rakes of Mallow,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wearing of the
Green,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last Rose of Summer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Girl I Left Behind
Me.&rdquo; <i>Jazz Legato</i> and <i>Jazz Pizzicato</i> are studies in contrasting moods
and dynamics. The <i>Jazz Pizzicato</i> consists of a jazz melody presented
entirely by plucked strings; its companion piece is a broader jazz melody
for bowed strings. <i>Plink, Plank, Plunk</i> also makes effective use of pizzicato
strings, this time attempting to simulate the sounds suggested by
the descriptive title. <i>Saraband</i> brings about the marriage between the
very old and very new in musical styles. The old classical dance in slow
triple time and accented second beat is exploited with a quickening of
tempo and with modern rhythmic and melodic embellishments.</p>
<p>In <i>Sleigh Bells</i>, jangling sleighbells and the sound of a cracking whip,
provide a delightful background to a jaunty tune that has the bite and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
sting of outdoor winterland. This piece has become something of a
perennial favorite of the Christmas season. In <i>The Syncopated Clock</i>,
the rhythm of a clicking grandfather&rsquo;s clock, presented by percussion
instruments in a modern rhythm, is placed against a bouncy, syncopated
melody. This number has become popular as theme music for the CBS-TV
&ldquo;Early Show.&rdquo; <i>The Trumpeter&rsquo;s Lullaby</i> is a sensitive melody with
the soothing accompaniment of a lullaby.</p>
<p><i>The Typewriter</i> permits members of the percussion section to imitate
the incisive, rigid rhythm of a functioning typewriter, punctuated by
the regular tinkle of the bell to provide the warning signal that the carriage
has come to the end of a line. Against this rhythm moves a vivacious
message in strings. <i>The Typewriter</i> was played in the motion picture
<i>But Not for Me</i>, starring Clark Gable, released in 1959. In <i>The
Waltzing Cat</i>, an imaginary cat dances gracefully to a waltz melody
made up mainly of meows.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">Daniel Fran&ccedil;ois <b id="g_Auber">Auber</b></span></h2>
<p>Daniel Fran&ccedil;ois Esprit Auber, genius of
op&eacute;ra-comique, was born in Caen, Normandy, France, on January 29,
1782. In his youth he lived in London, where he studied both the business
of art, in which he hoped to engage, and music. There he wrote
several songs which were heard at public entertainments. After returning
to France and settling in Paris in 1804, he gave himself up completely
to music. Two minor stage works with music were privately performed
between 1806 and 1811 before his first opera received its premi&egrave;re
performance: <i>Le S&eacute;jour militaire</i> in 1813. His first success came
seven years after that with <i>La Berg&egrave;re ch&acirc;telaine</i>. From then on he was
a prolific writer of both light and grand operas, many to texts by
Eug&egrave;ne Scribe. <i>La Muette de Portici</i> in 1828 was a triumph, and was
followed by such other major successes <i>Fra Diavolo</i> (1830), <i>Le Cheval</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
<i>de bronze</i> (1835), <i>Le Domino noir</i> (1837) and <i>Les Diamants de la
couronne</i> (1841). His last opera, <i>R&ecirc;ves d&rsquo;amour</i>, was completed when
he was eighty-seven. Auber was one of France&rsquo;s most highly honored
musicians. From 1842 until his death he was director of the Paris Conservatory,
and in 1857 he was made by Napoleon III Imperial Ma&icirc;tre
de Chapelle. Auber died in Paris on May 12, 1871.</p>
<p>With Adam and Boieldieu, Auber was one of the founding fathers of
the op&eacute;ra-comique. He was superior to his two colleagues in the lightness
of his touch, surpassing wit, and grace of lyricism. But Auber&rsquo;s
charm and gaiety were not bought at the expense of deeper emotional
and dramatic values; for all their lightness of heart, his best comic
operas are filled with pages that have the scope and dimension of grand
opera. As Rossini once said of him, Auber may have produced light
music, but he produced it like a true master.</p>
<p>Overtures to several of his most famous operas are standards in the
light-classical repertory.</p>
<p><i>The Black Domino</i> (<i>Le Domino noir</i>), text by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe, was introduced
in Paris on December 2, 1837. The central character is Lady
Angela, an abbess, who attends a masked ball where she meets and falls
in love with Horatio, a young nobleman. Numerous escapades and adventures
follow before Angela meets up again with her young man.
Now released from her religious vows by the Queen, Angela is free to
marry him.</p>
<p>In the overture, a loud outburst for full orchestra emphasizes a
strongly rhythmic theme. A staccato phrase in the woodwind and a return
of the initial strong subject follow. This leads into a light dancing
motive for the woodwind. Another <i>forte</i> passage is now the bridge to a
melodious episode in the woodwind. A change of key brings on a gay
bolero melody for clarinets and bassoons in octaves. After this idea is
amplified, a jota-like melody is given by the full orchestra. The closing
section is a brilliant presentation of a completely new jota melody.</p>
<p><i>The Crown Diamonds</i> (<i>Les Diamants de la couronne</i>) was first produced
in Paris on March 6, 1841, when it scored a major success. But it
enjoyed an even greater triumph when it was first performed in England
three years after that; from then on it has remained a great favorite
with English audiences. The text, by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe and Saint-Georges,
is set in 18th-century Portugal where the Queen assumes the
identity of the leader of a gang of counterfeiters and uses the crown
diamonds to get the money she needs to save her throne. When Don
Henrique falls into the unscrupulous hands of these counterfeiters, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Queen saves his life and falls in love with him. The throne is eventually
saved, and the crown jewels retrieved. The Queen now can choose Don
Henrique as her husband.</p>
<p>The overture opens with a sustained melody for the strings that is
dramatized by key changes. A rhythmic passage leads to a martial subject
for the brass. Several other vigorous ideas ensue in the brass and
woodwind. After their development there comes a lyrical string episode
which, in turn, leads into a second climax. Contrast comes with a lyrical
idea in the strings. A loud return of the first martial subject in full
orchestra marks the beginning of a spirited conclusion.</p>
<p><i>Fra Diavolo</i> was an immediate success when first given in Paris on
January 28, 1830; it has remained Auber&rsquo;s best known comic opera. It
has even received burlesque treatment on the Hollywood screen in a
comedy starring Laurel and Hardy. The text by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe has for
its central character a bandit chief by the name of Fra Diavolo who disguises
himself as an Italian Marquis. He flirts with a lady of noble birth,
hides in the bedroom of Zerlina, the inn-keeper&rsquo;s daughter, and is finally
apprehended by Zerlina&rsquo;s sweetheart, the captain of police.</p>
<p>This popular overture opens with a <i>pianissimo</i> drum roll, the preface
to a march tune for strings. The march music is extended to other instruments,
and as the volume increases it gives the impression of an
advancing army. It attains a <i>fortissimo</i> for full orchestra, then subsides.
The overture ends with several sprightly melodies from the first act
of the opera.</p>
<p><i>The Mute of Portici</i> (<i>La Muette de Portici</i>)&mdash;or, as it is sometimes
called, <i>Masaniello</i>&mdash;is a grand opera that contributed a footnote to the
political history of its times. First performed in Paris on February 29,
1828, it had profound repercussions on the political situation of that
period, and it is regarded by many as a significant influence in bringing
on the July Revolution in Paris in 1830. When first performed in Brussels
the same year, it instigated such riots that the occupying Dutch
were ejected from that country and Belgium now achieved independence.</p>
<p>The text by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe and Germain Delavigne is based on an
episode from history: a successful Neapolitan revolt against the Duke of
Arcos, headed by Tommaso Anello in 1647. In the opera, Masaniello
assumes Anello&rsquo;s part, and toward the end of the opera after the insurrection
is smothered, he is assassinated.</p>
<p>The overture begins with stormy music in full orchestra. After the
tempo slackens, a sensitive melody is presented by clarinets and bassoons
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
in octaves. The main section of the overture now unfolds, its
main theme divided between the strings and the woodwind. After a
<i>fortissimo</i> section for full orchestra, a second important melody is
heard in the woodwind and violins. The two main subjects are recalled
and developed. The overture closes with a coda in which percussion
instruments are emphasized.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Johann Sebastian <b id="g_Bach">Bach</b></span></h2>
<p>Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach, Germany,
on March 21, 1685. He was the most significant member of a
family that for generations had produced professional musicians. His
career can be divided into three convenient periods. The first was between
1708 and 1717 when, as organist to the Ducal Chapel in Weimar,
he wrote most of his masterworks for organ. During the second period,
from 1717 to 1723, he served as Kapellmeister to Prince Leopold in
Coethen. During this period he wrote most of his major works for
orchestra, solo instruments, and chamber-music ensembles. The last
period took place in Leipzig from 1723 until his death where he was
cantor of the St. Thomas Church. In Leipzig he produced some of his
greatest choral compositions. Towards the end of his life he went blind
and became paralyzed. He died in Leipzig on July 28, 1750.</p>
<p>As the culmination of the age of polyphony, Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s
masterworks are, for the most part, too complex and subtle for popular
appeal. But from his vast and incomparable output of concertos,
sonatas, suites, masses, passions, cantatas, and various compositions for
the organ and for the piano, it is possible to lift a few random items of
such melodic charm and simple emotional appeal that they can be
profitably exploited for wide consumption. In these less complicated
works, Bach&rsquo;s consummate skill at counterpoint, and his equally
formidable gift at homophonic writing, are always in evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The <i>Air</i> is one of Bach&rsquo;s most famous melodies, a soulful religious
song for strings. It can be found as the second movement of his Suite
No. 3 in D major for orchestra, but is often performed apart from the
rest of the work. August Wilhelmj transcribed this music for violin
and piano, calling it the <i>Air on the G String</i>. This transcription has
been severely criticized as a mutilation of the original; Sir Donald Francis
Tovey described it as a &ldquo;devastating derangement.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it
has retained its popularity in violin literature, just as the original has
remained a favorite in orchestral music.</p>
<p><i>Come Sweet Death</i> (<i>Komm, suesser Tod</i>) is a moving chorale for
voice and accompaniment: a simple and eloquent resignation to death.
It does not come from any of Bach&rsquo;s larger works but can be found in
Schemelli&rsquo;s collection (1736). It has become extremely popular in
orchestral transcriptions by Leopold Stokowski and Reginald Stewart,
but is also sometimes heard in arrangements for various solo instruments
and piano, as well as for the organ.</p>
<p><i>Jesu, Joy of Man&rsquo;s Desiring</i> (<i>Jesu bleibt meine Freude</i>) is probably
Bach&rsquo;s best known and most frequently performed chorale: a stately
melody introduced by, then set against, a gracefully flowing accompaniment.
This composition comes from the church cantata No. 147,
<i>Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben</i>. Various transcriptions have popularized
this composition, notably that for piano by Myra Hess, for
organ by E. Power Biggs, and for orchestra by Lucien Caillet.</p>
<p>The <i>Prelude in E major</i> is a vigorous and spirited piece of music
whose rhythmic momentum does not relax from the first bar to the last.
It appears as the first movement of the Partita No. 3 in E major for solo
violin. It is perhaps even better known in transcription than in the
original version, notably in those for violin and piano by Robert
Schumann and Fritz Kreisler, for solo piano by Rachmaninoff, and for
orchestra by Stokowski, Riccardo Pick-Mangiagalli, Sir Henry J. Wood,
and Lucien Caillet.</p>
<p>The <i>Siciliano</i> is a beautiful, stately song&mdash;the first movement of the
Sonata No. 4 in C minor for violin and accompaniment. Stokowski has
made a fine transcription for orchestra.</p>
<p><i>The Wise Virgins</i> is a ballet-suite comprising six compositions by
Bach drawn from his literature for the church and transcribed for
orchestra by the eminent British composer, Sir William Walton. It was
used for a ballet produced at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells in 1940. Frederick Ashton&rsquo;s
choreography drew its material from the parable of the Wise and Foolish
Virgins in the 25th chapter of the Gospel According to St. Matthew;
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
but this parable is seen through the eyes of the Italian Renaissance
painters. &ldquo;Ashton,&rdquo; wrote Arnold Haskell, &ldquo;has provided the perfect
meeting place for music and painting. The inspiration was pictorial
... it is equally musical. The movement and unfolding of the narrative
follow directly from the Bach music so brilliantly arranged and
orchestrated by William Walton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All six movements of the suite are so lyrical and emotional that their
impact on listeners is immediate. The first movement, &ldquo;What God
Hath Done Is Rightly Done&rdquo; comes from the opening chorus of a
cantata of the same name, No. 99 (<i>Was Gott tut das ist wohlgetan</i>). A
lively melody is first shared by strings and woodwind and then given
fanciful embellishments. A strong chorale melody for the brass is then
given prominent treatment. The second movement, &ldquo;Lord, Hear My
Longing&rdquo; is a chorale from the <i>Passion According to St. Matthew</i> which
is here given the treatment of an organ chorale-prelude with a tenderly
expressive chorale melody in woodwind amplified by strings. The third
movement, &ldquo;See What His Love Can Do&rdquo; is an expansive melody for
strings and woodwind against a flowing accompaniment; this music is
derived from Cantata No. 85, <i>Ich bin ein guter Hirt</i>. This is followed
by &ldquo;Ah, How Ephemeral,&rdquo; a dramatic page for full orchestra highlighting
a chorale for brass taken from Cantata No. 26, <i>Ach, wie fluechtig</i>.
The fifth section is the most famous. It is &ldquo;Sheep May Safely Graze&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>Schafe koennen sicher weiden</i>&rdquo;) from the secular Cantata No. 208,
<i>Was mir behagt</i>. An introductory recitative for solo violin leads to a
swaying melody for the woodwind. The lower strings then present a
pastoral song which soon receives beautiful filigree work from other
parts of the orchestra. The swaying subject for woodwind closes the
piece. Sir John Barbirolli also made an effective orchestral transcription
of this composition, while Percy Grainger arranged it for solo piano,
and Mary Howe for two solo pianos. The finale of the suite is &ldquo;Praise
Be to God,&rdquo; which is also the finale of Cantata No. 129, <i>Gelobet sei der
Herr, mein Gott</i>. This is vigorous music that is an outpouring of pure
joy.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">Michael <b id="g_Balfe">Balfe</b></span></h2>
<p>Michael William Balfe was born in Dublin, Ireland
on May 15, 1808. The son of a dancing master, Michael was only
six when he played the violin for his father&rsquo;s classes. In 1823, Balfe came
to London where he studied the violin and composition with private
teachers and earned his living as violinist and singer. Additional study
took place in Italy in 1825, including singing with Bordogni. Between
1828 and 1833 he appeared as principal baritone of the Italian Opera
and several other French theaters in Paris. In 1835, he initiated an even
more successful career as composer of English operas, with <i>The Siege
of Rochelle</i>, produced that year in London. He continued writing
numerous operas, producing his masterwork, <i>The Bohemian Girl</i>, in
1843. Between 1846 and 1856 Balfe traveled to different parts of Europe
to attend performances of his operas. In 1864 he left London to retire
to his estate in Rowney Abbey where he died on October 20, 1870.</p>
<p><i>The Bohemian Girl</i> is a classic of English opera. It was first produced
at Drury Lane in London on November 27, 1843, when it enjoyed a
sensational success. It was soon translated into French, German and
Italian and was extensively performed throughout Europe. The libretto,
by Alfred Bunn, was based on a ballet-pantomime by Vernoy de
Saint-Georges. The setting is Hungary in the 18th century, and its
heroine is Arline, daughter of Count Arnheim who, as a girl, had been
kidnapped by gypsies and raised as one of them. She is falsely accused
by the Count&rsquo;s men of stealing a valuable medallion from the Count&rsquo;s
palace and is imprisoned. Appearing before the Count to ask for clemency,
she is immediately recognized by him as his daughter.</p>
<p>Melodious selections from this opera are frequently heard. The most
famous single melody is &ldquo;I Dream&rsquo;d That I Dwelt in Marble Halls&rdquo;
which Arline sings in the first scene of the second act as she recalls a
dream. &ldquo;The Heart Bowed Down,&rdquo; the Count&rsquo;s song in the fourth
scene of the second act as he gazes longingly on a picture of his long
lost daughter, and &ldquo;Then You&rsquo;ll Remember Me,&rdquo; a tenor aria from
the third act are also familiar.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Hubert <b id="g_Bath">Bath</b></span></h2>
<p>Hubert Bath was born in Barnstaple, England, on November
6, 1883. He attended the Royal Academy of Music in London, after
which he wrote his first opera. For a year he was conductor of an opera
company that toured the world. After 1915 he devoted himself mainly
to composition. Besides his operas, tone poems, cantatas and various instrumental
works he wrote a considerable amount of incidental music
for stage plays and scores for the motion pictures. He died in Harefield,
England, on April 24, 1945.</p>
<p>The <i>Cornish Rhapsody</i>, for piano and orchestra, is one of his last
compositions and the most famous. He wrote it for the British motion
picture <i>Love Story</i>, released in 1946, starring Margaret Lockwood and
Stewart Granger. Lockwood plays the part of a concert pianist, and the
<i>Cornish Rhapsody</i> is basic to the story which involves the pianist with
a man in love with another woman. The rhapsody begins with arpeggio
figures which lead to a strong rhapsodic passage in full chords. A bold
section is then contrasted by a gentle melody of expressive beauty, the
heart of the composition. A cadenza brings on a return of the earlier
strong subject, and a recall of the expressive melody in the orchestra to
piano embellishments. The composition ends with massive passages
and strongly accented harmonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">Ludwig van <b id="g_Beethoven">Beethoven</b></span></h2>
<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany,
on December 16, 1770. He received his earliest musical training
in his native city where he early gave strong evidence of genius. He published
his first works when he was eleven, and soon thereafter was performing
publicly on the organ, cembalo, and the viola. He also disclosed
a phenomenal gift at improvisation. He established permanent
residence in Vienna in 1792. Three years later he made there his first
public appearance, and from then on began to occupy a high position in
Viennese musical life as a piano virtuoso. His fame as a composer soon
superseded that of virtuoso as he won the support of Vienna&rsquo;s aristocracy.
He entered upon a new creative phase, as well as full maturity,
beginning with 1800, when his first symphony was introduced in
Vienna. His creative powers continually deepened and became enriched
from that time on. As he restlessly sought to give poetic and dramatic
expression to his writing he broke down the classical barriers so long
confining music and opened up new horizons for style and structure.
Meanwhile, in or about 1801 or 1802, he realized he was growing deaf,
a discovery that swept him into despondency and despair, both of which
find expression in a unique and remarkable document known as the
Heiligenstadt Testament. Deafness led to personal idiosyncrasies and
volatile moods which often tried the patience of even his closest friends,
but it did not decrease the quantity of his musical production nor prevent
him from achieving heights of creative expression achieved by few,
if any. He died in Vienna on March 26, 1827 after having ushered in a
new age for music with his symphonies, concertos, sonatas, string quartets,
and masterworks in other categories including opera and choral
music.</p>
<p>The grandeur of expression, the profundity of thought, and the independence
of idiom we associate with Beethoven is not to be found in
his lighter music which, generally speaking, is in a traditional mold,
pleasing style, and in an inviting lyric vein. This is not the Beethoven
who was the proud democrat, whose life was a struggle with destiny,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
and who sought to make music the expression of his profoundest concepts.
This is rather, another Beethoven: the one who liked to dance,
though he did it badly; who flirted with the girls; and who indulged
in what he himself described as &ldquo;unbuttoned humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven wrote twelve <i>Contredanses</i> (<i>Contretaenze</i>) in 1801-1802.
These are not &ldquo;country dances&rdquo; as the term &ldquo;<i>contretaenze</i>&rdquo; is sometimes
erroneously translated. The Contredanse is the predecessor of the waltz.
Like the waltz it is in three-part form, the third part repeating the first,
while the middle section is usually a trio in contrasting mood. In 1801-1802,
when Beethoven wrote his <i>Contredanses</i>, he was already beginning
to probe deeply into poetic thought and emotion in his symphonies,
sonatas, and concertos. But in the <i>Contredanses</i> the poet becomes
peasant. This is earthy music, overflowing with melodies of folksong
vigor, and vitalized by infectious peasant rhythms. The <i>Contredanse</i>
No. 7 in E-flat major is particularly famous; this same melody was
used by the composer for his music to the ballet <i>Prometheus</i>, for the
finale of his <i>Eroica Symphony</i>, and for his Piano Variations, op. 35. The
key signatures of the twelve <i>Contredanses</i> are: C major, A major, D
major, B-flat major, E-flat major, C major, E-flat major, C major, A
major, C major, G major and E-flat major.</p>
<p>A half dozen years before he wrote his <i>Contredanses</i> Beethoven had
completed a set of twelve <i>German Dances</i> (<i>Deutsche Taenze</i>). The form,
style, and spirit of the <i>German Dance</i> is so similar to the <i>Contredanse</i>
that many Austrian composers used the terms interchangeably. Beethoven&rsquo;s
early <i>German Dances</i>, like the later <i>Contredanses</i>, are a reservoir
of lively and tuneful semi-classical music with an engaging earthy
quality to the melodies and a lusty vitality to the rhythms.</p>
<p>Few Beethoven compositions have enjoyed such universal approval
with budding pianists, salon orchestras, and various popular ensembles
as the <i>Minuet in G</i>. It is not too far afield to maintain that this is one
of the most famous minuets in all musical literature. Beethoven wrote
it originally for the piano; it is the second of a set of six minuets, written
in 1795, but published as op. 167. It is even more celebrated in its
many different transcriptions than it is in the original. The composition
is in three-part form. The first and third parts consist of a stately
classical melody; midway comes a fast-moving trio of contrasting spirit.</p>
<p>The first movement of the <i>Moonlight Sonata</i> is also often heard in
varied transcriptions for salon or &ldquo;pop&rdquo; orchestras. The <i>Moonlight
Sonata</i> is the popular name of the piano sonata in C-sharp minor, op.
27, no. 2 which Beethoven wrote in 1801 and which he designated as
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
<i>Sonata quasi una fantasia</i> mainly because of the fantasia character
of this first movement. The poetic and sensitive mood maintained
throughout the first movement&mdash;with a romantic melody of ineffable
sadness accompanied by slow triplets&mdash;is the reason why the critic Rellstab
(and <i>not</i> the composer) provided the entire sonata with the name
of &ldquo;Moonlight.&rdquo; To Rellstab this first movement evoked for him a picture
of Lake Lucerne in Switzerland at night time, gently touched by
the moonlight. The fact that Beethoven dedicated the sonata to Countess
Giulietta Guicciardi, with whom he was then in love, leads to a
legend that he wrote this music to express frustrated love, but this was
not the case. Another myth about this first movement is that Beethoven
improvised this music while playing for a blind boy, as moonlight
streamed into the window of his room; after he had finished playing he
identified himself to the awe-stricken youngster. It was the opinion of
the eminent critic, Henry E. Krehbiel, that the sonata was inspired by a
poem, <i>Die Beterin</i> by Seume, describing a young girl kneeling at an altar
begging for her father&rsquo;s recovery from a serious illness; angels descend
to comfort her and she becomes transfigured by a divine light.</p>
<p>Beethoven wrote two <i>Romances</i> for violin and orchestra: in F major,
op. 50 (1802) and G major, op. 40 (1803). Rarely do we encounter in
Beethoven&rsquo;s works such a fresh, spontaneous and entirely unsophisticated
outpouring of song&mdash;a song that wears its beauty on the surface&mdash;as
in these two compositions. The two <i>Romances</i> are companion pieces
and pursue a similar pattern. Each opens with the solo violin presenting
the main melody (in the F major accompanied by the orchestra, in
the G major, solo). Each then progresses to a pure outpouring of
lyricism followed by virtuoso passages for the solo instrument. In each,
violin and orchestra appear to be engaging in a gentle dialogue.</p>
<p>The <i>Turkish March</i> (<i>Marcia alla turca</i>) is one of several numbers
(the fourth) comprising the incidental music to a play by Kotzebue,
<i>The Ruins of Athens</i> (<i>Die Ruinen von Athen</i>), op. 113 (1811). The production
of this play with Beethoven&rsquo;s music was intended for the opening
of a theater in Pesth on February 9, 1812. The <i>Turkish March</i> is in
the pseudo-Turkish melodic style popular in Vienna in the early 19th
century, and it employs percussion instruments such as the triangle
which the Viennese then associated with Turkish music. The march,
with its quixotic little melody, begins softly, almost like march music
heard from a distance. It grows in sonority until a stirring climax is
achieved. Then it dies out gradually and ebbs away in the distance.
Leopold Auer made a famous transcription for violin and piano, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Beethoven himself transcribed it for piano, with six variations, op. 76
(1809).</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">Vincenzo <b id="g_Bellini">Bellini</b></span></h2>
<p>Vincenzo Bellini was born in Catania, Sicily, on November
3, 1801. Born to a musical family, he received music instruction
in childhood, and while still very young started composing. He then
attended the San Sebastiano Conservatory in Naples; during his stay
there he completed a symphony, two masses, and a cantata among other
works. He made his bow as opera composer with <i>Adelson e Salvini</i>, introduced
at the Conservatory in 1825. He continued writing operas
after that, and having them produced in major Italian opera houses
with varying degrees of success. <i>I Capuleti e i Montecchi</i>, given in
Venice in 1830, was a triumph. Then came the two operas by which
Bellini is today most often represented in the repertory: <i>La Sonnambula</i>
and <i>Norma</i>, both produced in 1831. In 1833 he came to Paris
where he completed his last opera, <i>I Puritani</i>, given in Paris in 1835.
He was at the height of his fame and creative powers when he died in
Puteaux, near Paris, on September 23, 1835, at the age of thirty-four, a
victim of intestinal fever.</p>
<p>Bellini was the genius of opera song. His fresh, pure lyricism&mdash;perfect
in design and elegant in style&mdash;elevates his greatest operas to a place
of significance. His masterwork is <i>Norma</i>, introduced at La Scala in
Milan on December 26, 1831, where it was at first a failure. The libretto
by Felice Romani was based on a tragedy by L. A. Soumet. In
Gaul, during the Roman occupation, in or about 50 B.C., Norma, high
priestess of the Druids, violates her vows by secretly marrying the
Roman proconsul, Pollione, and bearing him two sons. Pollione then
falls in love with Adalgisa, virgin of the Temple of Esus. Unaware that
Pollione is married, Adalgisa confides to Norma she is in love with him.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
With Pollione&rsquo;s infidelity now apparent, he is brought before Norma
for judgment. She offers him the choice of death or the renunciation of
Adalgisa. When Pollione accepts death, Norma confesses to her people
that, having desecrated her vows, she, too, must die. Moved by this
confession, Pollione volunteers to die at her side in the funeral pyre.</p>
<p>The overture is famous. Loud dramatic chords in full orchestra are
succeeded by a soft <i>lento</i> passage. A strong melody is then presented by
flutes and violins against an incisive rhythm. There follows a graceful,
sprightly and strongly accented tune in the strings. Both melodies are
then amplified, dramatized, and repeated; particular emphasis is placed
on the delicate, accented tune. The overture then proceeds to an energetic
conclusion.</p>
<p>One vocal episode from <i>Norma</i> is also extremely popular and is often
heard in orchestral transcriptions. It is Norma&rsquo;s aria, &ldquo;<i>Casta diva</i>,&rdquo;
surely one of the noblest soprano arias in all Italian operatic literature.
It comes in the first act and represents Norma&rsquo;s prayer for peace, and
her grief that the hatred of her people for the Roman invaders must
also result in their hatred for her husband, Pollione, the Roman proconsul.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">Ralph <b id="g_Benatzky">Benatzky</b></span></h2>
<p>Ralph Benatzky was born in Moravsk&eacute;-Budejovice, Bohemia,
on June 5, 1884. He acquired his musical training in Prague and
with Felix Mottl in Munich, after which he devoted himself to light
music by composing operettas. While residing at different periods in
Vienna, Berlin, and Switzerland, he wrote the scores for over ninety
operettas and 250 motion pictures, besides producing about five thousand
songs. His most successful operettas were <i>The Laughing Triple
Alliance</i>, <i>My Sister and I</i>, <i>Love in the Snow</i>, <i>Axel at the Gates of
Heaven</i>, and <i>The White Horse Inn</i>. He came to live in the United
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
States in 1940, but after World War II returned to Europe. He died in
Zurich on October 17, 1957.</p>
<p><i>The White Horse Inn</i> (<i>Im weissen Roess&rsquo;l</i>) is not only Benatzky&rsquo;s
most celebrated operetta, but also one of the most successful produced
in Europe between the two world wars, and possibly the last of the great
European operettas. It was first performed in Berlin in 1930, after
which it enjoyed over a thousand performances in Europe. Its premi&egrave;re
in America in 1936 (the book was adapted by David Freedman, lyrics
were by Irving Caesar, William Gaxton and Kitty Carlisle starred) was
only a moderate success. The operetta book of the original&mdash;freely
adapted by Erik Charell and Hans Mueller, from a play by Blumenthal
and Kadelburg&mdash;is set in the delightful resort of St. Wolfgang on
Wolfgangsee in Austria, in the era just before World War I. Leopold,
headwaiter of <i>The White Horse Inn</i>, is in love with its owner, Frau
Josepha, who favors the lawyer, Siedler. In a fit of temper she fires
Leopold, but upon learning that Emperor Franz Josef is about to pay
the inn a visit, she prevails upon him to stay on. Leopold makes a welcoming
speech to the Emperor, during which his bitter resentment
against Frau Josepha gets the upper hand. Later on, when Frau Josepha
confides to the Emperor that she is in love with Siedler, he urges her to
consider Leopold for a husband. Leopold then comes to Josepha with a
letter of resignation, which she accepts, but only because she is now
ready to give him a new position, as her husband.</p>
<p>Selections from this tuneful operetta include the main love song,
&ldquo;<i>Es muss ein wunderbares sein</i>,&rdquo; the ditty &ldquo;<i>Zuschau&rsquo;n kann ich nicht</i>,&rdquo;
and the lively waltz, &ldquo;<i>Im weissen Roess&rsquo;l am Wolfgangsee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is mainly the worldwide popularity of this operetta (even more
than the natural beauty of Wolfgangsee) that brings tourists each year
to the White Horse Inn at St. Wolfgang, for a sight of the operetta&rsquo;s
setting, and to partake of refreshments on the attractive veranda overlooking
Wolfgangsee. The inn is now generously decorated with pictures
in which the two main songs of the operetta are quoted, supplemented
by a portrait of Benatzky. Souvenir ashtrays also carry musical
quotations from the operetta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">Arthur <b id="g_Benjamin">Benjamin</b></span></h2>
<p>Arthur Benjamin was born in Sydney, Australia, on
September 18, 1893. His music study took place at the Royal College
of Music in London. After serving in World War I, he became professor
at the Sydney Conservatory, and in 1926 he assumed a similar post with
the Royal College of Music in London. Meanwhile in 1924 he received
the Carnegie Award for his <i>Pastoral Fantasia</i>, and in 1932 his first opera,
<i>The Devil Take Her</i>, was produced in London. For five years, beginning
with 1941, he was the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony. He
has written notable concertos, a symphony, and other orchestral music,
together with chamber works and several operas including <i>A Tale of
Two Cities</i> which won the Festival of Britain Prize following its premi&egrave;re
in 1953. He also wrote a harmonica concerto for Larry Adler.
Though many of his compositions are in an advanced style and technique,
Benjamin was perhaps best known for his lighter pieces, particularly
those in a popular South American idiom. He died in London on
April 10, 1960.</p>
<p>The <i>Cotillon</i> (1939) is a suite of English dances derived from a medley
entitled <i>The Dancing School</i>, published in London in 1719. Presented
by Benjamin in contemporary harmonic and instrumental dress,
these tunes&mdash;popular in England in the early 18th century&mdash;still retain
their appeal. A short introduction, built from a basic motive from the
first dance, leads to the following episodes with descriptive titles: &ldquo;Lord
Hereford&rsquo;s Delight&rdquo; for full orchestra; &ldquo;Daphne&rsquo;s Delight&rdquo; for woodwind
and strings; &ldquo;Marlborough&rsquo;s Victory,&rdquo; for full orchestra; &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s
Triumph&rdquo; for strings; &ldquo;Jig It A Foot&rdquo; for full orchestra; &ldquo;The
Charmer&rdquo; for small orchestra; &ldquo;Nymph Divine&rdquo; for small orchestra and
harp solo; &ldquo;The Tattler&rdquo; for full orchestra; and &ldquo;Argyll&rdquo; for full orchestra.
A figure from the final tune is given extended treatment in the
coda.</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s best known piece of music is the <i>Jamaican Rumba</i> (1942).
This is the second number of <i>Two Jamaican Pieces</i> for orchestra. A
light staccato accompaniment in rumba rhythm courses nimbly through
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the piece as the woodwinds present a saucy melody, and the strings a
countersubject. Consecutive fifths in the harmony, a xylophone in the
orchestration, and the changing meters created by novel arrangement
of notes in each measure, provide particular interest. The <i>Jamaican
Rumba</i> has been transcribed for various solo instruments and piano as
well as for piano trio.</p>
<p>The <i>North American Square Dances</i>, for two pianos and orchestra
(1955), is a delightful treatment of American folk idioms. The work
comprises eight fiddle tunes played at old-time square dances. The
native flavor is enhanced in the music by suggestions and simulations
of feet-stamping, voice calling, and the plunking of a banjo. In the Introduction
there appear fragments of the first dance; these same fragments
return in the coda. There are eight sections: Introduction and
&ldquo;Heller&rsquo;s Reel&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Old Plunk&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Bundle Straw&rdquo;; &ldquo;He Piped
So Sweet&rdquo;; &ldquo;Fill the Bowl&rdquo;; &ldquo;Pigeon on the Pier&rdquo;; &ldquo;Calder Fair&rdquo;; and
&ldquo;Salamanca&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coda.&rdquo; The fourth and seventh dances are in slow
tempo, while all others are fast.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Robert Russell <b id="g_Bennett">Bennett</b></span></h2>
<p>Robert Russell Bennett was born in Kansas
City, Missouri, on June 15, 1894. He began his music study in Kansas
City: piano with his mother; violin and several other instruments with
his father; and harmony with Carl Busch. While still a boy he wrote
and had published several compositions. He came to New York in 1916,
worked for a while as copyist at G. Schirmer, then during World War I
served for a year in the United States Army. After the war he spent
several years in Paris studying composition with Nadia Boulanger; during
this period he was twice the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship.
In 1926-1927 he received honorable mention for his first symphony, in
a contest sponsored by <i>Musical America</i>; in 1930 he received two awards
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
from RCA Victor, one for <i>Sights and Sounds</i>, an orchestral tone poem,
the other for his first successful and widely performed work, the symphony
<i>Abraham Lincoln</i>. Since then Bennett has worked fruitfully in
three distinct areas. As a composer of serious works he has produced
several operas (including <i>Maria Malibran</i>), symphonies and other significant
orchestral compositions. As an orchestrator for the Broadway
theater, he has been involved with some of the foremost stage productions
of our times including musicals by Rodgers and Hammerstein,
Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, and Lerner and Loewe, and many others. He
has also written compositions of a more popular nature, compositions
which, while fully exploiting the resources of serious music, are
nevertheless filled with popular or jazz materials. Among the last are
his effective symphonic adaptations of music from George Gershwin&rsquo;s
<i>Porgy and Bess</i>; <i>Oklahoma!</i> and <i>South Pacific</i> of Rodgers and Hammerstein;
and <i>Kiss Me Kate</i> of Cole Porter. In each instance, the main
melodies are brilliantly orchestrated and skilfully combined into an
integrated synthesis so that each becomes a coherent musical composition.</p>
<p>The <i>March</i>, for two pianos and orchestra, (1930) makes delightful use
of jazz melodies and rhythms. There are here four connected movements,
each in march time. The first movement, in a vigorous style,
leaps from one brief motive to another without any attempt at development.
In the second, a sustained melody, first for solo oboe and later for
the piano with full orchestra, is placed against a shifting rhythm. The
third is a serious recitative culminating in an episode in which the classic
funeral march is given sophisticated treatment. The fourth movement
begins with a <i>marche mignonne</i> and concludes with a forceful, at times
overpowering, statement of the funeral-march theme of the third movement.</p>
<p>While the <i>Symphony in D</i> (1941) is scored for symphony orchestra
and has been played by many leading American orchestras, it is music
with its tongue in the cheek, and is consistently light and humorous.
This symphony was written to honor the Brooklyn Dodger baseball
team (that is, when they were still in Brooklyn)&mdash;ironically enough an
ode to a colorful team by a composer who has been a lifelong rooter of
its most bitter rival, the New York Giants (once again, when they were
still at the Polo Grounds). There are four brief movements. The first,
subtitled &ldquo;Brooklyn Wins,&rdquo; &ldquo;means to picture the ecstatic joy of the
town after the home team wins a game,&rdquo; as the composer has explained.
This is followed by a slow (<i>Andante lamentoso</i>) movement, appropriately
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
designated as &ldquo;Brooklyn Loses&rdquo;&mdash;music filled with &ldquo;gloom and
tears, and even fury.&rdquo; The third movement, a scherzo, is a portrait of the
club&rsquo;s then (1941) president, Larry MacPhail, and his pursuit of a star
pitcher. &ldquo;We hear the horns&rsquo; bay call&mdash;then we hear him in Cleveland,
Ohio, trying to trade for the great pitcher, Bob Feller. He offers Prospect
Park and the Brooklyn Bridge as an even trade, but the Cleveland management
says &lsquo;No&rsquo; in the form of a big E-flat minor chord. After repeated
attempts we hear the hunting horns again, as he resumes the hunt in
other fields.&rdquo; The finale is a choral movement, and like that of Beethoven&rsquo;s
Ninth Symphony, an ode to joy. &ldquo;It is purely fictitious, this text,
but it speaks for itself. The subtitle of this finale is &lsquo;The Giants Come
to Town.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bennett has written two delightful orchestral compositions derived
from the songs of Jerome Kern. One is <i>Symphonic Study</i>, a synthesis of
some of Kern&rsquo;s best-loved melodies, and <i>Variations on a Theme by
Jerome Kern</i>. Both of these compositions are discussed in the section
on Kern. Bennett&rsquo;s symphonic treatment of George Gershwin&rsquo;s <i>Porgy
and Bess</i>, entitled <i>Symphonic Picture</i>, is commented upon in the Gershwin
section, specifically with <i>Porgy and Bess</i>; Bennett&rsquo;s symphonic
treatment of the music of Cole Porter&rsquo;s <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>, and of <i>Oklahoma!</i>
and <i>South Pacific</i> is spoken of in the sections devoted to Cole Porter
and Richard Rodgers, respectively. Bennett has also orchestrated, and
adapted into a symphonic suite, the music from Richard Rodgers&rsquo; <i>Victory
at Sea</i>, described in the Richard Rodgers section.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">Hector <b id="g_Berlioz">Berlioz</b></span></h2>
<p>Hector Berlioz was born in C&ocirc;te-Saint-Andr&eacute;, France on
December 11, 1803. As a young man he was sent to Paris to study medicine,
but music occupied his interests and he soon abandoned his medical
studies to enter the Paris Conservatory. Impatient with the academic
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
restrictions imposed upon him there, he left the Conservatory to begin
his career as a composer. From the very beginning he set out to open
new horizons for musical expression and to extend the periphery of
musical structure. His first masterwork was the <i>Symphonie fantastique</i>,
inspired by his love for the Shakespearean actress, Harriet Smithson. It
was introduced in Paris in 1830, a year in which Berlioz also won the
Prix de Rome. In his later works, Berlioz became one of music&rsquo;s earliest
Romantics. He was a bold innovator in breaking down classical restraint;
he helped extend the dramatic expressiveness of music; he was
a pioneer in the writing of program music and in enriching the language
of harmony, rhythm, and orchestration. Among his major works
are the <i>Requiem</i>, <i>Harold in Italy</i> for viola solo and orchestra, the
<i>Roman Carnival Overture</i>, the dramatic symphony <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
and <i>The Damnation of Faust</i>. Berlioz married Harriet Smithson in
1833. It proved to be a tempestuous affair from the outset, finally ending
by mutual consent in permanent separation. From 1852 until his
death Berlioz was a librarian of the Paris Conservatory. He was active
throughout Europe as a conductor and was a trenchant writer on
musical subjects; among his books is a volume of <i>Memoirs</i>. He died in
Paris on March 8, 1869.</p>
<p>The compositions by which Berlioz is most often heard on semi-classical
programs are three excerpts from <i>The Damnation of Faust</i>:
&ldquo;The Dance of the Sylphs&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Danse des sylphes</i>&rdquo;); &ldquo;The Minuet of the
Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisps&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Menuet des feux-follets</i>&rdquo;), and &ldquo;Rak&oacute;czy March&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>Marche hongroise</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p><i>The Damnation of Faust</i>, op. 24, described by the composer as a
&ldquo;dramatic legend,&rdquo; took many years for realization. It was based on a
French translation of Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, published in 1827. A year later,
Berlioz completed a musical setting of eight scenes as part of an ambitious
project to prepare a huge cantata based on the Faust legend. He
did not complete this project until eighteen years after that. Upon returning
to it, he revised his earlier material, and wrote a considerable
amount of new music. This work was first performed in oratorio style
in Paris on December 6, 1846 and was a fiasco. It was given a stage
presentation in Monte Carlo in 1903. Since then it has been performed
both in concert version and as an opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dance of the Sylphs&rdquo; is graceful waltz music, its main melody
assigned to the violins. It appears in the second part of the &ldquo;legend.&rdquo;
Faust is lulled to sleep by sylphs who appear in his dream in a delicate
dance which brings up for him the image of his beloved Marguerite.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
&ldquo;Minuet of the Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisps&rdquo; comes in the third part of the legend.
Mephisto summons the spirits and the will-of-the-wisps to encircle Marguerite&rsquo;s
house. The dance tune is heard in woodwind and brass. After
the trio section, the minuet melody is repeated twice, the second time
interrupted by chords after each phrase. The &ldquo;Rak&oacute;czy March&rdquo; is based
on an 18th-century Hungarian melody. It is logically interpolated into
the Faust legend by the expedience of having Faust wander about in
Hungary. A fanfare for the brass leads to the first and main melody, a
brisk march subject begun quietly in the woodwind. It gains in force
until it is exultantly proclaimed by full orchestra. A countersubject is
then heard in strings. After the march melody returns, it again gains in
volume until it is built up into an overpowering climax.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">Leonard <b id="g_Bernstein">Bernstein</b></span></h2>
<p>Leonard Bernstein was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts,
on August 25, 1918. Early music study took place with private
piano teachers, and subsequently with Helen Coates and Heinrich Gebhard.
He was graduated from Harvard in 1939 after which he attended
the Curtis Institute of Music (a pupil of Fritz Reiner in conducting)
and three summer sessions of the Berkshire Music Center as a student
and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Serge Koussevitzky. He made a sensational debut as conductor
with the New York Philharmonic in 1943, appearing as a last-minute
substitute for Bruno Walter who had fallen ill. Since that time
he has risen to the front rank of contemporary symphony conductors,
having led most of the world&rsquo;s leading organizations, and being appointed
music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1958. As a
serious composer he first attracted attention with the <i>Jeremiah Symphony</i>
in 1944, which was performed by most of America&rsquo;s leading
orchestras, was recorded, and received the New York City Music Critics
Award. He subsequently wrote other major works for orchestra as well
as the scores to successful ballets, an opera, and several Broadway musical
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
comedies that were box-office triumphs; the last of these included
<i>On the Town</i> (1944), <i>Wonderful Town</i> (1953) and <i>West Side Story</i>
(1957). Bernstein has also distinguished himself as a musical commentator
and analyst over television, concert pianist, and author.</p>
<p>Whether writing in a serious or popular vein Bernstein consistently
reveals himself to be a master of his technical resources, endowed with
a fine creative imagination, a strong lyric and rhythmic gift, and a restless
intelligence that is ever on the search for new and fresh approaches
in his writing. High on the list of favorites in the semi-classical repertory
are the orchestral suites he adapted from his two popular and successful
ballets.</p>
<p><i>Facsimile</i>, choreography by Jerome Robbins, was introduced in New
York in 1946. The ballet scenario revolves around three lonely people&mdash;a
woman and two men&mdash;who find only frustration and disenchantment
after trying to find satisfactory personal relationships. The orchestral
suite from this vivacious score, vitalized with the use of popular melodies
and dance rhythms, is made up of four parts. I. &ldquo;Solo.&rdquo; The principal
musical material here is found in a solo flute. This is a description
of a woman standing alone in an open place. II. &ldquo;Pas de Deux.&rdquo; Woman
meets man, and a flirtation ensues to the tune of a waltz. The scene
achieves a passionate climax, and is followed by a sentimental episode,
romanticized in the music by a subject for muted strings and two solo
violins and solo viola. The love interest dies; the pair become bored,
then hostile. III. &ldquo;Pas de trois.&rdquo; The second man enters. This episode
is a scherzo with extended piano solo passages. A triangle ensues between
the two men and one woman, there is some sophisticated interplay
among them, and finally there ensue bitter words and misunderstandings.
IV. &ldquo;Coda.&rdquo; The two men take their departure, not without
considerable embarrassment.</p>
<p><i>Fancy Free</i> was Bernstein&rsquo;s first ballet, and it is still his most popular
one; he completed his score in 1944 and it was introduced by the Ballet
Theater (which had commissioned it) on April 18 of that year. It was a
success of major proportions, received numerous performances, then
became a staple in the American dance repertory. It is, wrote George
Amberg, &ldquo;the first substantial ballet entirely created in the contemporary
American idiom, a striking and beautifully convincing example
of genuine American style.&rdquo; The scenario, by Jerome Robbins, concerned
the quest of girl companionship on the part of three sailors on
temporary shore leave. Bernstein&rsquo;s music, though sophisticated in its
harmonic and instrumental vocabulary, is filled with racy jazz rhythms
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
and idioms and with melodies cast in a popular mold. The orchestral
suite is made up of five parts: &ldquo;Dance of the Three Sailors&rdquo;; &ldquo;Scene at
the Bar&rdquo;; &ldquo;Pas de deux&rdquo;; &ldquo;Pantomime&rdquo;; &ldquo;Three Variations&rdquo; (Galop,
Waltz, Danzon) and Finale.</p>
<p>When this Suite was first performed, in Pittsburgh in 1945, with
Bernstein conducting, the composer provided the following description
of what takes place in the music. &ldquo;From the moment the action
begins, with the sound of a juke box wailing behind the curtain, the
ballet is strictly Young America of 1944. The curtain rises on a street
corner with a lamppost, side street bar, and New York skyscrapers
tricked out with a crazy pattern of lights, making a dizzying background.
Three sailors explode onto the stage; they are on shore leave
in the city and on the prowl for girls. The tale of how they meet first
one girl, then a second, and how they fight over them, lose them, and
in the end take off after still a third, is the story of the ballet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Fancy Free</i> was expanded into a musical-comedy by Betty Comden
and Adolph Green, for which Bernstein wrote his Broadway score.
Called <i>On the Town</i> it started a one-year Broadway run on December
28, 1944, and subsequently was twice revived in off-Broadway productions,
and was made into an outstanding screen musical.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">Georges <b id="g_Bizet">Bizet</b></span></h2>
<p>Georges Bizet was born in Paris on October 25, 1838. Revealing
a pronounced gift for music in early childhood he was entered
into the Paris Conservatory when he was only nine. There&mdash;as a pupil
of Marmontel, Hal&eacute;vy, and Benoist&mdash;he won numerous prizes, including
the Prix de Rome in 1857. In that year he also had his first stage
work produced, a one-act opera, <i>Le Docteur miracle</i>. After his return
from Rome to Paris he started to write operas. <i>Les P&ecirc;cheurs de perles</i>
(<i>Pearl Fishers</i>) and <i>La jolie fille de Perth</i> were produced in Paris in
1863 and 1867 respectively. Success came in 1872 with his first Suite
from the incidental music to Daudet&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Arl&eacute;sienne</i>. After that came his
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
masterwork, the opera by which he has earned immortality: <i>Carmen</i>,
introduced in Paris two months before his death. Bizet died in Bougival,
France, on June 3, 1875.</p>
<p>His gift for rich, well-sounding melodies, and his feeling for inviting
harmonies and tasteful orchestration make many of his compositions
ideal for programs of light music, even salient portions of <i>Carmen</i>.</p>
<p><i><span id="agnus">Agnus Dei</span></i> is a vocal adaptation (to a liturgical Latin text) of the
intermezzo from Bizet&rsquo;s incidental music to <i>L&rsquo;Arl&eacute;sienne</i>. It is also
found as the second movement of the <i>L&rsquo;Arl&eacute;sienne Suite No. 2</i>. A
dramatic dialogue between forceful strings and serene woodwinds leads
into a spiritual religious song.</p>
<p>The <i>Arl&eacute;sienne Suite No. 1</i> is made up of parts from the incidental
music, which Bizet wrote for the Proven&ccedil;al drama of Alphonse Daudet,
<i>The Woman of Arles</i> (<i>L&rsquo;Arl&eacute;sienne</i>). The play, with Bizet&rsquo;s music consisting
of twenty-seven pieces, was given at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du Vaudeville
in Paris in 1872. Out of this score the composer selected four excerpts
and assembled them into an orchestral suite, which has become his most
celebrated instrumental composition, and his first success as a composer.
A knowledge of the plot and characters of the Daudet play is by no
means essential to a full appreciation of Bizet&rsquo;s tuneful suite.</p>
<p>The first movement, &ldquo;Prelude,&rdquo; begins with a march melody based
on an old French Christmas song. This is subjected to a series of variations.
After the march tune has been repeated vigorously by the full
orchestra there appears a pastoral interlude, scored originally for
saxophones, but now usually heard in clarinets. This, in turn, is succeeded
by a passionate song for strings, with brass and woodwind accompaniment.
The second movement is a &ldquo;Minuet,&rdquo; whose principal theme
is a brisk and strongly accented subject. In the trio section, the clarinet
appears with a flowing lyrical episode. As the violins take this material
over they become rapturous; the harp and woodwind provide intriguing
accompanying figures. A brief &ldquo;<i>Adagietto</i>&rdquo; comes as the third movement.
This is a sensitive romance for muted strings. In the finale,
&ldquo;Carillon,&rdquo; we get a picture of a peasant celebration of the Feast of
St. Eloi. The horns simulate a three-note chime of bells which accompanies
a lively dance tune, first in strings, then in other sections of the
orchestra. A soft interlude is interposed by the woodwind. Then the
lively dance reappears, once again to be accompanied by vigorous tolling
bells simulated by the horns.</p>
<p>There exists a second suite made up of four more numbers from the
incidental music to <i>L&rsquo;Arl&eacute;sienne</i>. This was prepared after Bizet&rsquo;s death
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
by his friend, Ernest Guiraud. This second suite is rarely played, but
its second movement, &ldquo;Intermezzo,&rdquo; is celebrated in its liturgical version
as &ldquo;<i>Agnus Dei</i>&rdquo; (which see <a href="#agnus">above</a>). The other movements are Pastorale,
Minuet and Farandole.</p>
<p>If the name of Bizet has survived in musical history and will continue
to do so for a long time to come, it is surely because of a single
masterwork&mdash;his opera <i>Carmen</i>. This stirring music drama&mdash;based on
the famous novel of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, adapted for Bizet by Meilhac
and Hal&eacute;vy&mdash;never fails in its emotional and dramatic impact. Carmen
is the seductive gypsy girl who enmeshes two lovers: the bull fighter
Escamillo, and the sergeant, Don Jos&eacute;. Both she and Don Jos&eacute; meet a
tragic end on the day of Escamillo&rsquo;s triumph in the bull ring. The background
to this fatal story of love and death is provided by the Spanish
city of Seville&mdash;its streets, bull ring, taverns, and nearby mountain retreat
of smugglers.</p>
<p><i>Carmen</i> was introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique on March 3, 1875.
Legend would have us believe it was a fiasco, and further that heartbreak
over this failure brought about Bizet&rsquo;s premature death two
months after the opera was first heard. As a matter of historic truth,
while there were some critics at that first performance who considered
the text too stark and realistic for their tastes, <i>Carmen</i> did very well,
indeed. By June 18th it enjoyed thirty-seven performances. At the start
of the new season of the Op&eacute;ra-Comique it returned to the repertory to
receive its fiftieth presentation by February 15, 1876. It was hailed in
Vienna in 1875, Brussels in 1876, and London and New York in 1878.
Many critics everywhere were as enthusiastic as the general public,
and with good reason. For all the vivid color of Spanish life and backgrounds,
and all the flaming passions aroused by the sensual Carmen,
were caught in Bizet&rsquo;s luminous, dramatic score.</p>
<p>The Prelude to <i>Carmen</i> represents a kind of resum&eacute; of what takes
place in the opera, and with some of its musical material. It opens with
lively music for full orchestra describing the festive preparations in
Seville just before a bull fight. After a sudden change of key, and several
chords, the popular second-act song of Escamillo, the bullfighter, is
first given quietly in strings, then repeated more loudly. Then there is
heard an ominous passage against quivering strings which, in the opera,
suggests the fatal fascination exerted by Carmen on men. This is repeated
in a higher register and somewhat amplified until a dramatic
chord for full orchestra brings this episode, and the overture itself, to
a conclusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The Prelude to Act II is constructed from a motive of an off-stage
unaccompanied little song by Don Jos&eacute; in the same act praising the
dragoons of Alcala. The Prelude to Act III is actually an entr&rsquo;acte, a
gentle little intermezzo which Bizet originally wrote for <i>L&rsquo;Arl&eacute;sienne</i>.
The Prelude to Act IV is also an entr&rsquo;acte, this time of dramatic personality.
The brilliant and forceful music is based upon an actual
Andalusian folk song and dance; it sets the mood for the gay festivities
in a public square on the day of a gala bull-fight with which the fourth
act opens.</p>
<p>It is sometimes a practice at concerts of semi-classical or pop music
to present not merely one of the four orchestral Preludes but also at
other times salient musical episodes from the opera, arranged and
assembled into fantasias or suites. These potpourris or suites are generally
made up of varied combinations of the following excerpts. From
Act I: the &ldquo;Changing of the Guard&rdquo;; Carmen&rsquo;s seductive and extremely
popular aria, the Habanera (&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;amour est un oiseau rebelle</i>&rdquo;), which
was not by Bizet but borrowed by him from a song by Sebastian Yradier
(see <a href="#c186">Yradier</a>); the duet of Mica&euml;la and Don Jos&eacute;, &ldquo;<i>Qui sait de quel
d&eacute;mon</i>&rdquo;; and Carmen&rsquo;s S&eacute;guidille, &ldquo;<i>Pr&egrave;s des ramparts de S&eacute;ville</i>.&rdquo; From
Act II: &ldquo;The March of the Smugglers,&rdquo;; Carmen&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Chanson boh&egrave;me</i>&rdquo;;
the rousing Toreador Song of Escamillo; and Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s poignant
&ldquo;Flower Song&rdquo; to Carmen, &ldquo;<i>La fleur que tu m&rsquo;avais jet&eacute;e</i>.&rdquo; From Act
III: Carmen&rsquo;s Card Song, &ldquo;<i>En vain pour &eacute;viter</i>&rdquo;; and Mica&euml;la&rsquo;s celebrated
Air, &ldquo;<i>Je dis que rien ne m&rsquo;&eacute;pouvante</i>&rdquo;. From Act IV: the
Chorus, March, and Finale.</p>
<p>Utilizing many of these selections, Ferruccio Busoni and Vladimir
Horowitz each prepared striking concert fantasias for solo piano; Pablo
de Sarasate, for violin and piano; and Franz Waxman for violin and
orchestra for the motion picture, <i>Humoresque</i>, starring John Garfield.</p>
<p><i>Children&rsquo;s Games</i> (<i>Jeux d&rsquo;enfants</i>) is a delightful suite of twelve
pieces for piano (four hands) for and about children. Bizet wrote it in
1871, but shortly afterwards orchestrated five of these numbers and
assembled them into a suite, op. 22. The first movement is a march
entitled &ldquo;Trumpeter and Drummer&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Trompette et tambour</i>&rdquo;) music
punctuated by trumpet calls and drum rolls, accompanying a troop of
soldiers as it approaches and then disappears into the distance. This is
followed by a tender berceuse for muted strings, &ldquo;The Doll&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>La
Poup&eacute;e</i>&rdquo;). The third movement is &ldquo;The Top&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>La Toupie</i>&rdquo;), an impromptu
in which the violins simulate the whirr of a spinning top
while the woodwinds introduce a jolly dance tune. The fourth movement,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
&ldquo;Little Husband, Little Wife&rdquo; (<i>&ldquo;Petit mari, petite femme&rdquo;</i>) is a
quiet little dialogue between husband and wife, the former represented
by first violins, and the latter by the cellos. The suite ends with
&ldquo;The Ball&rdquo; (&ldquo;Le Bal&rdquo;), a galop for full orchestra.</p>
<p>The <i>Danse boh&egrave;mienne</i> is a popular orchestral episode that comes
from a comparatively unknown (and early) Bizet opera, <i>La jolie fille de
Perth</i>, introduced in Paris in 1867. This vital dance music appears in
the second act, but it is also often borrowed by many opera companies
for the fourth act ballet of <i>Carmen</i>. The harp leads into, and then
accompanies, a soft, sinuous dance melody for the flute. The tempo
rapidly quickens, and the mood grows febrile; the strings take over the
dance melody in quick time, and other sections of the orchestra participate
vigorously.</p>
<p><i>La Patrie</i> Overture, op. 19 (1873) is music in a martial manner. A
robust, strongly rhythmed march tune is immediately presented by the
full orchestra. After some amplification it is repeated softly by the
orchestra. The second main theme is a stately folk melody first given by
the violins, clarinets and bassoons, accompanied by the double basses.
This new subject receives resounding treatment in full orchestra and
is carried to a powerful climax. After a momentary pause, a third tune
is heard, this time in violas and cellos accompanied by brasses and
double basses, and a fourth, in violas, clarinets and English horn with
the muted violins providing an arpeggio accompaniment. Then the
stirring opening march music is recalled and dramatized. The overture
ends in a blaze of color after some of the other themes are brought
back with enriched harmonies and orchestration.</p>
<p>This music was written for a play of the same name by Sardou.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">Luigi <b id="g_Boccherini">Boccherini</b></span></h2>
<p>Luigi Boccherini was born in Lucca, Italy, on February
19, 1743. After studying music with various private teachers in Rome,
he gained recognition as a cellist both as a member of theater orchestras
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
in Lucca and later on tour throughout Europe in joint concerts with
Filippo Manfredi, violinist. He served as court composer in Madrid
from 1785 to 1787, and from 1787 until 1797 for Friedrich Wilhelm II
of Prussia. His last years were spent in Madrid in poverty and poor
health, and he died in that city on May 28, 1805.</p>
<p>Boccherini, a contemporary of Haydn, was a prolific composer of
symphonies, concertos, and a considerable amount of chamber music
which were all-important in helping to develop and crystallize a classical
style of instrumental writing and in establishing the classic forms of
instrumental music.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of his creation in virtually every branch of
instrumental music, and despite the significance of his finest works,
Boccherini is remembered today by many music lovers mainly for a
comparatively minor piece of music: the sedate <i>Minuet</i> which originated
as the third movement of the String Quintet in E major, op. 13, no. 5.
Transcribed for orchestra, and for various solo instruments and piano,
(even for solo harpsichord) this light and airy Minuet has become one
of the most celebrated musical examples of this classic dance form.</p>
<p>Several of Boccherini&rsquo;s little known melodies from various quintets
and from his Sinfonia No. 2 in B-flat were used by the contemporary
French composer, Jean Fran&ccedil;aix, for a ballet score, from which comes
an enchanting little orchestral suite. The ballet was <i>The School of
Dancing</i> (<i>Scuola di Ballo</i>), with book and choreography by Leonide
Massine; it was introduced by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in
Monte Carlo in 1933. The book was set in the dancing school of Professor
Rigadon. The professor tries to palm off one of his backward
pupils on an impresario, while withholding his star; in the end all
pupils leave him in disgust. The suite is in four parts. The first consists
of &ldquo;<i>Le&ccedil;on</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Menuet</i>&rdquo;; the second, &ldquo;<i>Larghetto</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Rondo</i>,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<i>Dispute</i>&rdquo;; the third, &ldquo;<i>Presto</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Pastorale</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Danse allemande</i>&rdquo;;
the last, &ldquo;<i>Sc&egrave;ne du notaire</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Finale</i>.&rdquo; An unidentified
program annotator goes on to explain: &ldquo;An occasional stern note in the
&lsquo;<i>Le&ccedil;on</i>&rsquo; and strong chords in the &lsquo;<i>Menuet</i>&rsquo; suggest the teacher. The
violin and bassoon play a duet which very clearly pictures the inept
pupil. Further atmosphere is furnished by a guitar-like accompaniment
heard on the harp from time to time. One is soon acquainted with
the characters who reappear in the various sections. The &lsquo;<i>Larghetto</i>&rsquo;
closely resembles a movement in one of Haydn&rsquo;s symphonies, which
suggests a tempting line of speculation. The orchestration of the
&lsquo;<i>Rondo</i>&rsquo; and the syncopation of the &lsquo;<i>Danse allemande</i>&rsquo; are noteworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">Fran&ccedil;ois <b id="g_Boieldieu">Boieldieu</b></span></h2>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois-Adrien Boieldieu, genius of op&eacute;ra-comique,
was born in Rouen, France, on December 16, 1775. After
studying music with Charles Broche, Boieldieu became a church organist
in Rouen in his fifteenth year. Two years later his first opera, <i>La fille
coupable</i>, was successfully given in the same city. In 1796 he came to
Paris where from 1797 on his operas began appearing in various theaters,
climaxed by his first major success, <i>Le Calife de Bagdad</i> in 1801.
In 1798 he was appointed professor of the piano at the Paris Conservatory.
From 1803 until 1811 he lived in Russia writing operas for the
Imperial theaters and supervising musical performances at court. After
returning to Paris in 1811, he reassumed his significant position in
French music. From 1817 to 1826 he was professor of composition at
the Paris Conservatory, and in 1821 he was made Chevalier of the
Legion of Honor. All the while he kept on writing operas and enjoying
considerable popularity. His most significant work was the op&eacute;ra-comique,
<i>La Dame blanche</i>, a sensation when introduced in Paris in
1825. Ill health compelled him to abandon his various professional
activities in 1832. Supported by an annual government grant, he withdrew
to Jarcy where he spent the last years of his life devoting himself
mainly to painting. He died there on October 8, 1834. Boieldieu, with
Adam and Auber, was one of the founders of French comic opera, and
his best works are still among the finest achieved in this <i>genre</i>.</p>
<p>The Overture to <i>The Caliph of Bagdad</i> (<i>Le Calife de Bagdad</i>) is
Boieldieu&rsquo;s most famous piece of music. The opera was a triumph when
introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in Paris on September 16, 1801. The
libretto, by Saint-Just, is set in Bagdad where Isaaum is a benevolent
Caliph, but given to mischievous pranks and tricks, including parading
around the city in various disguises. Once, as an army officer, he meets
and makes love to Zeltube. Her mother, suspicious of him, orders his
arrest. When the Caliph reveals himself, he also discloses his intentions
were honorable and that he intends making Zeltube his bride.</p>
<p>The overture opens with a mellow song for strings. When the tempo
changes, a sprightlier tune is heard in strings and brought to a forceful
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
climactic point. The music now assumes a dramatic character after
which a new subject, again in a sensitive lyrical vein, is offered by the
strings.</p>
<p>The Overture to <i>La Dame blanche</i> (<i>The White Lady</i>) is also popular.
<i>La Dame blanche</i> is the composer&rsquo;s greatest work in the op&eacute;ra-comique
form. It was received with such sensational acclaim when introduced
in Paris on December 10, 1825 that, temporarily at any rate, the sparkling
comic operas of Rossini (then very much in vogue) were thrown
into a shade. In time, <i>La Dame blanche</i> received universal acceptance
as a classic in the world of op&eacute;ra-comique. Between 1825 and 1862 it
enjoyed over a thousand performances in Paris; by World War I, the
total passed beyond the fifteen hundred mark. The libretto, by Eug&egrave;ne
Scribe, is based on two novels by Sir Walter Scott, <i>The Monastery</i> and
<i>Guy Mannering</i>. The setting is Scotland, and the &ldquo;white lady&rdquo; is a
statue believed to be the protector of a castle belonging to the Laird of
Avenel. The castle is being administered by Gaveston who tries to use
the legend of the white lady for his own selfish purposes, to gain possession
of the family treasures. Anna, Gaveston&rsquo;s ward, impersonates
the white lady to help save the castle and its jewels for the rightful
owner.</p>
<p>The vivacious overture is made up of several of the opera&rsquo;s principal
melodies. The introduction begins with a motive from the first-act
finale, and is followed by the melodious and expressive &ldquo;Ballad of the
White Lady.&rdquo; The Allegro section that follows includes the drinking
song and several other popular arias, among these being the ballad of
&ldquo;Robin Adair&rdquo; which appears during the hero&rsquo;s first-act revery and as a
concert piece in the third act.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">Giovanni <b id="g_Bolzoni">Bolzoni</b></span></h2>
<p>Giovanni Bolzoni was born in Parma, Italy, on May 14,
1841. He attended the Parma Conservatory, then achieved recognition
as a conductor of operas in Perugia and Turin. In 1887 he became director
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
of the Liceo Musicale in Turin. Bolzoni wrote five operas, a symphony,
overtures, and chamber music, but all are now in discard. He
died in Turin on February 21, 1919.</p>
<p>About the only piece of music by Bolzoni to survive is a beguiling
little Minuet which comes from an unidentified string quartet and
which has achieved outstanding popularity in various transcriptions,
including many for salon orchestras with which it is a perennial
favorite.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">Carrie Jacobs <b id="g_Bond">Bond</b></span></h2>
<p>Carrie Jacobs Bond, whose art songs are among the
most popular by an American, was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on
August 11, 1862. Coming from a musical family, she was given music
instruction early, and made appearances as a child-prodigy pianist.
After marrying Dr. Frank L. Bond, a physician, she went to live in
Chicago where her husband died suddenly, leaving her destitute. For
a while she earned a living by renting rooms, taking in sewing, and
doing other menial jobs. Then she began thinking of supplementing
this meager income with the writing of songs. To issue these compositions,
she formed a modest publishing firm in New York with funds
acquired from her New York song recital; for a long time her office was
in a hall bedroom. Her first publication, just before the end of the century,
was <i>Seven Songs</i>, which included &ldquo;I Love You Truly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Just
a Wearyin&rsquo; For You,&rdquo; each of which she subsequently published as
separate pieces. In 1909 she achieved a formidable success with the
famous ballad, &ldquo;The End of a Perfect Day,&rdquo; of which more than five
million copies of sheet music were sold within a few years. Her later
songs added further both to her financial security and her reputation.
She was invited to give concerts at the White House, received awards
for achievement in music from various organizations, and was singled
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
out in 1941 by the Federation of Music Clubs as one of the two outstanding
women in the field of music. She died in Hollywood, California,
on December 28, 1946.</p>
<p>Carrie Jacobs Bond knew how to write a song that was filled with
sentiment without becoming cloying, that was simple without becoming
ingenuous, and which struck a sympathetic universal chord by virtue of
its mobile and expressive lyricism. Besides &ldquo;I Love You Truly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Just
a Wearyin&rsquo; for You&rdquo; and &ldquo;The End of a Perfect Day,&rdquo; her most famous
songs included &ldquo;His Lullaby,&rdquo; &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s Garden,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Done My Work,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Roses Are in Bloom.&rdquo; Her songs are so popular that they have
been often heard in various transcriptions for salon orchestras and
band.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">Alexander <b id="g_Borodin">Borodin</b></span></h2>
<p>Alexander Borodin was born in St. Petersburg, Russia,
on November 11, 1833. He was trained in the sciences, having attended
the Academy of Medicine in St. Petersburg and in 1858 receiving his
doctorate in chemistry. He continued after that to devote himself to
scientific activities, both in and out of Russia. He produced several significant
papers and, from 1859 to 1862, served on an important scientific
mission.</p>
<p>He had also received some musical training in his boyhood. In 1862
he began to direct his energies with equal vigor to music as well as to
science. He soon joined four colleagues (Mussorgsky, Balakirev, Cui,
and Rimsky-Korsakov) in forming a national school of composition
henceforth identified as &ldquo;The Mighty Five&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Russian Five.&rdquo;
Like the other members of this group, Borodin concerned himself with
the creation of a national Russian musical art, well grounded in Russian
folk song and dance, Russian culture and history. In this style he
produced three symphonies, the folk opera <i>Prince Igor</i>, two string quartets,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
and various operas and instrumental compositions. He differed
from the other members of the &ldquo;Russian Five&rdquo; by his partiality to Oriental
melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and instrumental colors, and by
his preference for exotic subjects. Borodin died in St. Petersburg on
February 27, 1887.</p>
<p><i>In the Steppes of Central Asia</i> (1880) is a popular tone poem for
orchestra, one of several <i>tableaux vivants</i> (&ldquo;living pictures&rdquo;) commissioned
from various composers to honor the 25th anniversary of the
reign of Czar Alexander II. Each <i>tableau vivant</i> was intended to portray
an incident from the Russian past, or a picture of a Russian scene.
Borodin prepared his own programmatic note to explain his music; it
appears in the published score. &ldquo;Over the uniformly sandy steppes of
Central Asia come sounds of a peaceful Russian song. Along with them
are heard the melancholy strains of Oriental melodies, then the stamping
of approaching horses and camels. A caravan, accompanied by Russian
soldiers, traverses the measureless waste. With full trust in its protective
escort, it continues its long journey in a carefree mood. Onward
the caravan moves. The songs of the Russians and those of the Asiatic
natives mingle in common harmony. The refrains curl over the desert
and then die away in the distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peaceful Russian song is given by the clarinet, while the &ldquo;melancholy
strains of Oriental melodies&rdquo; is an expressive song for English
horn. These two melodies are the core of a composition that is free
in form.</p>
<p>The <i>Nocturne</i> (<i>Notturno</i>) is a haunting, poetic song for strings, the
third movement of the composer&rsquo;s String Quartet No. 2 in D major
(1885). It is often heard apart from the rest of the work, particularly in
various transcriptions for orchestra, or for violin and piano. In 1953,
furnished with lyrics and adapted into a popular song by Robert
Wright and George &ldquo;Chet&rdquo; Forrest, it was heard in the Broadway
musical <i>Kismet</i> as &ldquo;This Is My Beloved&rdquo; and became an outstanding
hit.</p>
<p>The <i>Polovtsian Dances</i> come from <i>Prince Igor</i>, a folk opera with
libretto by Vladimir Stassov based on an old Russian chronicle. It was
introduced at the Imperial Opera in St. Petersburg in 1890. The setting
is 12th-century Central Asia where a Tartar race, known as the Polovtzi,
capture Prince Igor and his son, Vladimir. Though captives, Prince
Igor and his son are regaled by the leader of the Tartars with a lavish
feast and Oriental dances. It is at this point in the opera (Act 2) that the
popular <i>Polovtsian Dances</i> appear. They are exciting aural experiences
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
because of their primitive rhythms, exotic Oriental melodies, and
flaming instrumental colors. One of the dances is a poignant melody for
flute and oboe; another is a dance of savage men in which the main
melody in clarinet is set against a sharply accented phrase of four descending
notes; a third is barbaric, a syncopated melody for strings
accompanied by crash of cymbals; a fourth is a haunting Oriental song
divided by violins and cellos. This last melody was used by Robert
Wright and George &ldquo;Chet&rdquo; Forrest for their popular song hit of 1953,
&ldquo;Stranger in Paradise,&rdquo; in their Broadway musical, <i>Kismet</i>. The concluding
dance is again in a savage manner. A passionate melody is begun
by the woodwind and carried on by the strings, while receiving a vigorous
horn accompaniment.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">Felix <b id="g_Borowski">Borowski</b></span></h2>
<p>Felix Borowski was born in Burton, England, on March
10, 1872. He received his musical training at the Cologne Conservatory
and with private teachers in England. In 1897 he settled in the United
States where he later became a citizen. From 1897 to 1916 he was professor
of harmony and counterpoint at Chicago Musical College, and from
1916 to 1925 its president. His career in music criticism began in 1905.
From 1907 to 1917 he was music critic of the Chicago <i>Record-Herald</i>
and from 1942 until his death, of the Chicago <i>Sun</i>. He was also program
annotator for the concerts of the Chicago Symphony from 1908 on, some
of these annotations being published in the books, <i>Standard Concert
Guide</i> and <i>Encyclopedia of the Symphony</i>. Borowski died in Chicago,
Illinois, on September 6, 1956.</p>
<p>As a composer, Borowski produced three symphonies, three string
quartets, several ballet-pantomimes, various tone poems and other instrumental
compositions. His major works are now rarely given, but his
smaller salon pieces have retained their popularity through the years.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
The best of these are the <i>Adoration</i>, for violin and piano, the <i>La
Coquette</i> and <i>Valsette</i> for piano, all transcribed for orchestra. All three
pieces are in simple song structure and unashamedly Romantic in their
lyricism and emotional content. The uninhibited sentimentality of
<i>Adoration</i> has made that piece a particular favorite.</p>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">Johannes <b id="g_Brahms">Brahms</b></span></h2>
<p>Johannes Brahms was born in Hamburg, Germany, on
May 7, 1833. He received instruction in music from his father, Otto
Cossel, and Eduard Marxsen. At fourteen he gave his first public concert
as pianist, in which he introduced one of his own compositions. In
1853 he toured with the Hungarian violinist, Eduard Rem&eacute;nyi, as his
accompanist. During this period he met and aroused the interest of
such notable musicians as Joachim, Liszt, and Schumann. The last of
these was one of the first to give Brahms public recognition, through a
glowing article in the <i>Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik</i>. After a considerable
amount of travel in Germany and Austria, and after holding various
musical positions, Brahms established himself permanently in Vienna
in 1863. The promise he had shown in his early piano and chamber
music became fully realized with his first piano concerto in 1857, the
<i>German Requiem</i> written between 1857 and 1868, and the first symphony
completed in 1876. In his later orchestral, piano, and chamber
music he assumed a position of first importance in the German Romantic
movement, the spokesman for absolute music, the genius who succeeded
in combining respect for classical discipline and tradition with
the Romanticist&rsquo;s bent for emotion, poetry, and flexible thought.
Brahms died in Vienna on April 3, 1897.</p>
<p>The supreme craftsmanship, mature thought, and profound feelings
of Brahms&rsquo; music do not lend themselves to popular consumption.
Occasionally, though not frequently, he chose to give voice to a lighter
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
mood, as he did in his ever-popular <i>Hungarian Dances</i>. In such music,
as in his more ambitious works, he is always the master of form and
style, and a powerful and inventive creator.</p>
<p>The <i>Cradle Song</i> (<i>Wiegenlied</i>) is Brahms&rsquo; universally loved art song,
one of the most famous lullabies ever written. It is the fourth in a collection
of five songs, op. 49 (1868). Its lyric is a folk poem (&ldquo;<i>Guten
Abend, Gute Nacht</i>&rdquo;). In its many and varied transcriptions, this lullaby
has become an instrumental favorite.</p>
<p>The <i>Hungarian Dances</i> was originally published in 1869 in two volumes
for four-hand piano. The first book contained dances Nos. 1
through 5, while the second book had Nos. 6 through 10. Brahms took
special pains to point out that these melodies were not his own, but
were adaptations. On the title page there appeared the phrase &ldquo;arranged
for the piano.&rdquo; Brahms further refused to place an opus number
to his publication as another indication that this was not original
music; and in a letter to his publisher, Simrock, he explained he was
offering this music &ldquo;as genuine gypsy children which I did not beget
but merely brought up with bread and milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Brahms&rsquo; open candor about the origin of these melodies, a
storm of protest was sounded by many newspapers and musicians accusing
Brahms of plagiarism. Fortunately, the general public refused to
be influenced by this unjust accusation. The two volumes of <i>Hungarian
Dances</i> were a formidable success, the greatest enjoyed by Brahms up
to that time.</p>
<p>In 1880, Brahms issued two more volumes of <i>Hungarian Dances</i>, still
for four-hand piano. Book 3 had dances Nos. 11 through 16, and Book
4, Nos. 17 through 21. This time many of the melodies were original
with Brahms, even if modeled after the style and idiosyncrasies of actual
Hungarian folk dances and gypsy melodies.</p>
<p>The <i>Hungarian Dances</i> are most popular in transcriptions for orchestra.
Brahms himself transcribed Dances Nos. 1, 3, and 10; Andreas Hellen,
Nos. 2, 4, and 7; Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, Nos. 7 through 21; and Albert Parlow,
the rest. Walter Goehr and Leopold Stokowski also made transcriptions
of several of these dances for orchestra. In addition, Brahms adapted
Book 1 for piano solo, and Joachim all the dances for violin and piano.</p>
<p>The dances range from sentimental to passionate moods. They
abound with abrupt contrasts of feeling and dynamics; they are often
vital with vertiginous rhythms and changing meters. These gypsy
melodies, both the gay and the sad, warm the heart like Tokay wine; the
pulse of the rhythm is similarly intoxicating. As Walter Niemann wrote
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
of these dances: &ldquo;They are pure nature music, full of unfettered, vagrant,
roving spirit, and a chaotic ferment, drawn straight from the
deepest well springs of music by children of Nature. It seems impossible
to imprison them in the bonds of measure, time, and rhythm, to convert
their enchantingly refreshing uncivilized character, their wild
freedom, their audacious contempt for all order into a civilized moderation
and order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Brahms was able to discipline this music with modern techniques
without robbing it either of its personality or popular appeal. &ldquo;He has
maintained,&rdquo; continues Niemann, &ldquo;and preserved the essential, individual
genuine features of gypsy music in his musical idiom: the dances
sound like original Hungarian folk music ... and for this reason they
delight and enchant everybody: the amateur by their natural quality,
the specialist by their art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most famous of these dances is the fifth in F-sharp minor, its passionate,
uninhibited dance melody released at once by the strings against
a strong rhythm.</p>
<p>The following are some other popular dances.</p>
<p>No. 1, in G minor. A slow and languorous dance unfolds in strings,
and then is contrasted by a slight, tripping theme in woodwind; a second
languorous dance melody follows in the strings.</p>
<p>No. 6 in D-flat major. A slow syncopated melody begins sensually
but soon gains in tempo and volume; a second arresting dance tune is
then offered by strings against strong chords in the rest of the orchestra.</p>
<p>No. 7 in A major. This dance opens with a vivacious melody in
strings, but through most of the piece a comparatively restrained mood
is maintained.</p>
<p>No. 12 in D minor. The first dance melody is presented in a halting
rhythm by the woodwind against decorative figures in the strings. This
is followed by two other dance tunes, the first in strings with trimmings
in the woodwind, and the second in full orchestra.</p>
<p>No. 19 in B minor and No. 21 in E minor. Both are fleet and graceful
both in melody and rhythm.</p>
<p>The <i>Waltz in A-flat major</i>, a graceful dance which is given without
any introduction or coda, originated as a piece for piano duet: the
fifteenth of a set of sixteen such waltzes op. 39 (1865). All of Brahms&rsquo;
waltzes reveal their Viennese identity in their charm and lightness of
heart. Some are derivative from the waltzes of Johann Strauss II, but
the one in A-major is more in the character of a Schubert Laendler
than a Strauss waltz, though it does boast more delicacy and refinement
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
than we usually find in peasant dances. David Hochstein&rsquo;s transcription
for violin and piano is in the concert violin repertory.</p>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">Charles Wakefield <b id="g_Cadman">Cadman</b></span></h2>
<p>Charles Wakefield Cadman was born in Johnstown,
Pennsylvania, on December 24, 1881. As a boy he played the organ
in a church near Pittsburgh, and wrote a march that was published. His
main music study took place with private teachers: Leo Oehmler,
Luigi von Kunits, and Emil Paur. From 1908 to 1910 he was the music
critic of the Pittsburgh <i>Dispatch</i>. Meanwhile, a meeting in 1902 with
the lyric writer Nellie Richmond Eberhart, turned him to the writing
of songs in which he achieved his initial outstanding successes as composer.
Some of these were inspired by the American Indian. Later researches
in the field of American-Indian ceremonials and music led him
to write his opera <i>Shanewis</i>, produced by the Metropolitan Opera in
1918, as well as several significant instrumental works including the
<i>Thunderbird Suite</i> and <i>To a Vanishing Race</i>. From 1917 until his
death he lived in California where he wrote several major orchestral
and chamber-music works, but none in the American-Indian idiom
with which he became famous. He died in Los Angeles on December
30, 1946.</p>
<p>The <i>American Suite</i>, for strings (1938), is an engaging piece of music
in which Cadman makes use of several different American folk idioms.
In the first movement he borrows his melodies from the tribal music
of Omaha Indians. In the second movement we hear Negro folk tunes
indigenous to South Carolina. And in the third movement, two old
fiddle tunes are effectively employed, &ldquo;Sugar in the Gourd,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hoop-de-den-do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Dawning&rdquo; is one of Cadman&rsquo;s two most famous songs. It sold
millions of copies of sheet music and records, and has been translated
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
into many languages. Though originally published in 1906, it reposed
forgotten and unknown on the shelves of the publisher (Oliver Ditson)
until John McCormack sang it at one of his recitals in 1909 and was
given an ovation. &ldquo;At Dawning&rdquo; was transcribed for violin and piano
by Fritz Kreisler.</p>
<p><i>Dark Dancers of Mardi Gras</i>, for orchestra with piano, (1933), is one
of Cadman&rsquo;s most popular symphonic compositions. The composer
explains: &ldquo;The work takes its name from the Negro side of the Mardi
Gras, though no Negro themes are used. The Negroes of New Orleans
have a Mardi Gras of their own. The fantasy is supposed to reflect the
fantastic, the grotesque, the bizarre spirit of the carnival. The original
theme goes into a major key in the central section, and might represent
the romantic feeling of the King and Queen, and the Court in carnival
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Land of the Sky-Blue Water&rdquo; is the second of Cadman&rsquo;s
two outstandingly successful songs. It is one of four songs with lyrics by
Nellie Richmond Eberhart appearing in <i>American-Indian Songs</i>, op.
45, a cycle which was published in Boston in 1909 and in the same year
received a prize in a contest sponsored by the Carnegie Institute. This
song was first swept to national fame by the prima donna, Lillian
Nordica, in her song recitals. It soon entered the repertory of virtually
every leading concert singer in America. Fritz Kreisler transcribed it
for violin and piano.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">Lucien <b id="g_Caillet">Caillet</b></span></h2>
<p>Lucien Caillet was born in Dijon, France on May 22,
1891. After attending the Dijon Conservatory he came to the United
States in 1918 and settled first in Pennsylvania, and later in California.
He has distinguished himself by his skilful symphonic transcriptions of
compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach, Mussorgsky, and others. In his
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
own works he frequently makes skilful use, and astute adaptations, of
some famous pieces of popular music.</p>
<p>The <i>Fantasia and Fugue on Oh, Susanna!</i> (1942) for orchestra has
for its point of departure the famous song of Stephen Foster, &ldquo;Oh,
Susanna!&rdquo; Caillet&rsquo;s composition begins with a preface: a tutti for orchestra
which quotes the melody only partly. This leads into a fantasia
section featuring the solo string quartet and presenting a quiet version
of the melody. A fugue follows, the germ of the &ldquo;Susanna&rdquo; melody
found in first and second violins in unison.</p>
<p>In <i>Pop Goes the Weasel</i> for orchestra (1938) Caillet brings the full
resources of his harmonic and instrumental skill to a famous American
folk tune. &ldquo;Pop Goes the Weasel&rdquo; is a Western two-part melody, long a
favorite of country fiddlers since before the Civil War. After presenting
this melody, Caillet subjects it to intriguing variations, sometimes with
comic effect.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">Alfredo <b id="g_Catalani">Catalani</b></span></h2>
<p>Alfredo Catalani was born in Lucca, Italy, on June 19,
1854. After receiving preliminary instruction in music from his father
he was allowed to enter the Paris Conservatory without examinations.
He concluded his music study at the Milan Conservatory, where in 1886
he succeeded Ponchielli as professor of composition. In 1880 he had
his first opera, <i>Elda</i>, produced in Turin. He continued to confine himself
to the stage, his most successful operas being <i>Loreley</i> in 1890, and
<i>La Wally</i> in 1892. In his own time, and shortly thereafter, his operas
were outstandingly successful in Italy. Today they are remembered almost
exclusively because of some orchestral excerpts. Catalani died in
Milan on August 7, 1893.</p>
<p>The most popular episodes from Catalini&rsquo;s two most famous operas
are dances often performed by salon orchestras. &ldquo;The Dance of the
Waves&rdquo; (<i>Danza delle ondine</i>) and &ldquo;The Waltz of the Flowers&rdquo; (<i>Valzer</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
<i>dei fiori</i>) appear in <i>Loreley</i>, an opera introduced in Turin in 1890. In
this opera the action takes place on the banks of the Rhine. Walter,
about to marry Anna, is loved by the orphan girl, Loreley. When Loreley
learns she is about to lose her beloved, she calls upon the nymphs
and the sprites of the Rhine to help her; throwing herself into the
river, she becomes one of them. During the wedding ceremonies, Loreley
appears and entices Walter away from his bride. Anna dies of grief;
and Walter meets his doom in the Rhine, to which he is helplessly
drawn through enticements by the sprites and by Loreley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dance of the Waves&rdquo; takes place in the last act. After Anna&rsquo;s
funeral procession passes by, Walter comes to the edge of the Rhine,
grief-stricken. Out of the waters come the sprites to dance seductively
before Walter and to beckon him on into the river. &ldquo;The Waltz of the
Flowers&rdquo; is a graceful, even gentle, dance performed in the second act,
during the wedding ceremonies of Walter and Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Waltz of the Kiss&rdquo; (<i>Valzer del bacio</i>) is a segment from <i>La
Wally</i>, Catalani&rsquo;s most famous opera, which was such a particular
favorite of Arturo Toscanini that not only did he conduct it frequently
in Italy but he also named his son after its heroine. <i>La Wally</i> was introduced
at La Scala in Milan in 1892. The text, by Luigi Illica, was based
on a novel by Wilhelmine von Hillern. The setting is 19th century
Switzerland where Wally and Hagenbach are in love, and meet their
death in an avalanche; all the while Wally is being sought after by
Gellner, whom she detests. The &ldquo;Waltz of the Kiss&rdquo; is a caressing piece
of music from the second act which accompanies a dance by Wally and
Hagenbach, in which they first discover they are in love and yield to
passionate kissing while the hateful Gellner watches.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">Otto <b id="g_Cesana">Cesana</b></span></h2>
<p>Otto Cesana was born in Brescia, Italy, on July 7, 1899. He
came to the United States in boyhood and studied music with private
teachers. After working in Hollywood, where he wrote a considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
amount of music for motion pictures, he came to New York to become
arranger for Radio City Music Hall, and for several important radio
programs. In his own music he has been particularly successful in using
within large forms popular American elements, at times folk idioms. In
a more serious attitude he has produced half a dozen symphonies and
various concertos for solo instruments and orchestra.</p>
<p><i>Negro Heaven</i> for orchestra is one of his more popular attempts to
use an American folk idiom within a symphonic mold. He explains:
&ldquo;Here follows a musical interpretation of the fluctuating moods that
seize the colored man&mdash;now gay, now sad, always, however migrating
towards carefreeness and abandon, as exemplified in the return of the
first subject, which is soon followed by one of those superlative moods,
a Negro in the throes of nostalgia.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Swing Septet</i> (1942), for string orchestra, guitar and percussion is in
three short movements, the first in sonata form, and the last two in
three-part song form. &ldquo;The chief purpose,&rdquo; says the composer, &ldquo;is to
give the string players an opportunity to compete with the ad lib boys
who, while they improvise the wildest phrases imaginable, are &lsquo;floored&rsquo;
whenever an approximation of that material is set down on paper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">Emmanuel <b id="g_Chabrier">Chabrier</b></span></h2>
<p>Emmanuel Chabrier was born in Ambert, France, on
January 18, 1841. He was trained as a lawyer; from 1862 to 1880 he was
employed at the Ministry of the Interior in Paris. But he had also received
a sound musical training with private teachers. Composition began
for him in earnest in the 1870&rsquo;s, with two of his operettas receiving
performances in Paris between 1877 and 1879. In 1879 he made a pilgrimage
to Germany to hear Wagner&rsquo;s music dramas whose impact
upon him proved so overwhelming that he finally decided to give up
his government work and concentrate on music. Returning to Paris in
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
1880 he published the <i>Pi&egrave;ces pittoresques</i> for piano. Following a visit to
Spain he produced in 1883 his first major work for orchestra and realized
with it his first major success as a composer&mdash;the rhapsody <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i>.
He also wrote two operas, <i>Gwendoline</i> produced in 1886, and <i>Le Roi
malgr&eacute; lui</i> introduced one year later. Some of his best writing was for
the piano and included such distinguished works as the <i>Habanera</i>,
<i>Bourr&eacute;e fantasque</i>, and <i>Trois valses romantiques</i>. Chabrier became a
victim of paralysis in the last two years of his life, and just before his
death he began losing his sanity. He died in Paris on September 13,
1894.</p>
<p>While in his operas he revealed his profound indebtedness to the
Wagnerian idiom, Chabrier was at his best either in music that interpreted
Spain or to which he brought a natural bent for laughter, gaiety,
and the grotesque.</p>
<p><i>Espa&ntilde;a</i>, an orchestral rhapsody, is his most famous composition, as
popular in the semi-classical literature as it is in the symphonic repertory.
Chabrier wrote it in 1883 after a Spanish holiday, and its premi&egrave;re
in Paris on November 4 of that year was a sensation. This rhapsody is
built from three principal subjects, two borrowed from Spanish folk
melodies, and one Chabrier&rsquo;s own. A nervous rhythm in plucked strings
leads to a strongly accented malague&ntilde;a, first heard in the wind instrument.
Different sections take it over before soaring strings arrive with
a lyrical jota melody. Chabrier&rsquo;s own theme, a stately subject for trombones,
is then heard, set against the background of the malague&ntilde;a
melody. The French waltz-king, Waldteufel, used Chabrier&rsquo;s themes
from <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i> for one of his most famous waltzes, also entitled <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Joyeuse marche</i> (1888) reveals the composer in one of his satirical
moods. Chabrier wrote it at first as a piano composition to be used for
a sight-reading class at the Bordeaux Conservatory. It proved too difficult
to fulfil this function, and Chabrier decided to orchestrate it, calling
it <i>Joyeuse marche</i> and presenting it as one of his more serious endeavors.
The music is in a burlesque style, believed to be a musical
description of drunken musicians staggering home after a festive evening.
The work opens with an orchestral flourish, following which the
oboe offers a capricious subject. This gaiety is maintained in the lively
second theme for the violins.</p>
<p>The <i>Suite pastorale</i> (1880) is an orchestral adaptation of four of the
ten piano pieces in <i>Pi&egrave;ces pittoresques</i>. In the first, &ldquo;<i>Idylle</i>,&rdquo; a beautiful
melody is accompanied by plucked strings. The second, &ldquo;<i>Danse villageoise</i>&rdquo;
is a country dance in which the lively dance tune is first heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
in clarinets. The third piece, &ldquo;<i>Sous bois</i>&rdquo; has a pastoral character, while
the concluding number, &ldquo;<i>Scherzo-Valse</i>&rdquo; is a protracted piece of pulsating
music.</p>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">George <b id="g_Chadwick">Chadwick</b></span></h2>
<p>George Whitefield Chadwick was born in
Lowell, Massachusetts, on November 13, 1854. Most of his music study
took place in Germany. When he was being graduated from the Leipzig
Conservatory in 1879, his overture <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> received its premi&egrave;re
performance. He then studied organ and composition with Rheinberger
in Munich. After returning to the United States in 1880, he
became a teacher of harmony and composition at the New England
Conservatory, rising to the post of director in 1897. He was also active
for several years as director of the Worcester Music Festival. He died in
Boston on April 4, 1931.</p>
<p>Chadwick was a prolific composer of symphonies, concertos, and
various other orchestral and choral works. He never freed himself from
the influence of German Romanticism, with which he had been infected
during his student days. He wrote with a sure craftsmanship,
usually filling his classical structures with winning melodies and often
lush harmonies and orchestration.</p>
<p>Two compositions for orchestra are of particular popular appeal:
<i>Jubilee</i> and <i>No&euml;l</i>. Both are movements from the <i>Symphonic Sketches</i>
(1895) which received its world premi&egrave;re in Boston in 1908. (The other
two movements, the third and fourth, are &ldquo;Hobgoblin&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Vagrom
Ballad.&rdquo;) <i>Jubilee</i> is a vigorous tonal picture of a carnival. A spirited
melody is loudly presented by the full orchestra and is elaborated upon.
A second virile subject is then presented by bass clarinet, bassoons,
violas and cellos. Following a lively return of the opening carnival
theme, the woodwind and horns appear with a lyrical subject. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
music then gains in vitality until it comes to a rousing conclusion with
a coda built from the carnival motive.</p>
<p><i>No&euml;l</i> has been described as &ldquo;a little Christmas song.&rdquo; It is a haunting
orchestral nocturne in which a serene Yuletide melody is offered by the
English horn.</p>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">C&eacute;cile <b id="g_Chaminade">Chaminade</b></span></h2>
<p>C&eacute;cile Chaminade was born in Paris on August 8, 1857.
Music study took place in Paris with Marsick and Godard among others.
In 1875 she launched her career as concert pianist by touring Europe
in programs that often included her own compositions. At her American
debut, on November 7, 1908, she appeared as soloist with the Philadelphia
Orchestra in a performance of her own <i>Concerstueck</i>. She wrote
many other ambitious works including a symphony, two orchestral
suites, and ballets. She died in Monte Carlo on April 18, 1944.</p>
<p>Though Chaminade staked her future as composer on her larger,
serious works for orchestra and the ballet stage, she is today remembered
almost exclusively for her slight morsels of the salon variety.
Most of these originated as compositions for the piano; her piano music
numbers about two hundred works including arabesques, etudes, impromptus,
valse-caprices, and so forth. <i>Automne</i>, a sentimental melody,
and <i>S&eacute;r&eacute;nade espagnole</i>, in a pseudo-Spanish style, come from her piano
music: <i>Automne</i> from the <i>Concert Etudes</i>, op. 35. It has been transcribed
for popular orchestra by Melachrino. <i>S&eacute;r&eacute;nade espagnole</i> has
been adapted for violin and piano by Fritz Kreisler. Chaminade&rsquo;s most
popular piece, <i>Scarf Dance</i>, comes from a ballet, <i>Callirho&euml;</i>, produced in
Marseilles in 1888. It is often heard in its original orchestral version
and in various transcriptions for solo piano, and solo instrument and
piano.</p>

<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">Gustave <b id="g_Charpentier">Charpentier</b></span></h2>
<p>Gustave Charpentier was born in Dieuze, France,
on June 25, 1860. He received his musical training in the Conservatories
in Lille and Paris, winning the Prix de Rome in 1881. During his
stay in Rome he wrote <i>Impressions of Italy</i> for orchestra, with which he
realized his first success upon its premi&egrave;re performance in Paris in 1892.
Charpentier&rsquo;s fame, however, rests securely on a single opera, <i>Louise</i>, a
triumph when introduced in Paris on February 2, 1900, and since become
recognized as one of the major achievements of the French lyric
theater. A sequel, <i>Julien</i> (1913), was a failure. From 1913 on, Charpentier
wrote almost nothing more, living a Bohemian existence in the
Montmartre section of Paris where he died on February 18, 1956.</p>
<p><i>Impressions of Italy</i>, a suite for orchestra (1890) is a nostalgic picture
of five Italian scenes. The first movement is &ldquo;Serenade,&rdquo; in which is
described a picture of young men emerging from a bistro at midnight,
singing love songs under the windows of their girl friends. &ldquo;At the
Fountain&rdquo; depicts girls parading with dignified steps near a waterfall
by a ravine; from the distance come the sounds of a shepherd&rsquo;s tune.
&ldquo;On Muleback&rdquo; tells of evening as it descends on the Sabine Mountains.
The mules trot along, and there rises the song of the muleteer
followed by the sweet love song of girls riding in their carts to the
village. &ldquo;On the Heights&rdquo; presents noontime on the heights overlooking
Sorrento. All is peace, though the toll of bells can be heard from a distance.
The finale is a musical tribute to a great city, &ldquo;Naples.&rdquo; In this
music we see the crowds of the city, the parading bands. A tarantella is
being danced in the streets. The strains of a sentimental folk song drift
in from the quay. Evening falls, and fireworks electrify the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="small">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric <b id="g_Chopin">Chopin</b></span></h2>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, genius of music for
the piano, was born in Zelazowa Wola, Poland, on February 22, 1810.
He began to study the piano at six. One year later he made his first
public appearance and wrote his first piece of music. His later music
study took place privately with Joseph Elsner and at the Warsaw Conservatory
from which he was graduated with honors in 1829. In that
year he visited Vienna where he gave two successful concerts of his
works. He left Poland for good in 1830, settling permanently in Paris a
year after that. He soon became one of the most highly regarded musicians
in France, even though he gave only a few public concerts. In 1837
he first met the writer, George Sand, with whom he was involved emotionally
for about a decade, and under whose influence he composed
some of his greatest music. Always sensitive in physique and of poor
health, Chopin suffered physically most of his adult life. He died in
Paris on October 17, 1849 and was buried in P&egrave;re Lachaise.</p>
<p>Chopin produced 169 compositions in all. Practically all of them are
for the piano, and most within the smaller forms. In writing for the
piano he was an innovator who helped change the destiny of piano
style and technique. He is often described as the poet of the keyboard,
by virtue of his sensitive and deeply affecting lyricism (usually beautifully
ornamented), his always exquisite workmanship, and his profound
emotion. Many of his works are nationally Polish in expression.</p>
<p>The Etude in E major, op. 10, no. 3 (1833) is one of two of Chopin&rsquo;s
most famous works in the etude form. While an etude is essentially a
technical exercise, Chopin produced twenty-seven pieces for piano
which, though they still probe various technical problems, are nevertheless
so filled with poetic thought and musical imagination that they
belong in the realm of great art and must be numbered with his most
significant compositions. That in E major is one of his most beautiful
melodies, a soulful song rather than a technical exercise; Chopin himself
regarded this as one of his most inspired pages. One of the many
transcriptions of this composition existing is for the voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The so-called <i>Revolutionary Etude</i>&mdash;C minor, op. 10, no. 12 (1833)&mdash;was
inspired by the tidings received by Chopin while he was traveling
from Vienna to Paris that Warsaw had fallen to the Russians. His first
impulse was to rush back home and join in the battle. He was dissuaded
from doing this by his family, and instead he sublimated his
intense patriotic feelings by writing a fiery piece of national music,
full of the spirit of defiance. Since then this etude has become as inextricably
associated with Poland and its national aspirations and ideals
as, for example, is Sibelius&rsquo; <i>Finlandia</i> with Finland. This etude was
repeatedly played over the Polish radio when Nazi Germany first attacked
Poland in 1939, a continual inspiration to the defenders of Warsaw;
it was the last piece of music played over the Polish radio before
the Germans took over.</p>
<p>In the Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor, op. 66 (1834), Chopin
makes a structural compromise between the forms of the fantasy and
the impromptu. In doing so, he produced one of his best known
melodies, a melody that appears after a fast bravura opening. This is a
flowing sentimental song that was used for the popular American tune,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Always Chasing Rainbows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Funeral March</i> is surely the most celebrated funeral music ever
written. It is found as the third movement of the Sonata No. 2 in B-flat
minor, for piano, op. 35 (1839). In various arrangements, especially for
orchestra, for band and for organ, this music has accompanied the dead
to their final resting place in every part of the civilized world. In three-part
form, the first section consists of a slow, mournful march. In the
middle trio a more reflective mood is projected, almost like a kind of
gentle recollection of the dead and the good he had performed. The
opening mournful tread returns after this trio to bring the composition
to its conclusion.</p>
<p>The fifty-five Mazurkas are among the most national of Chopin&rsquo;s
compositions, those in which he most fervently expressed his strong
feelings about his native land. The Mazurka is a Polish dance in &frac34;
time, somewhat slower in tempo than the waltz, and highly varied in
rhythm and emotion. In Chopin&rsquo;s Mazurkas we find, on the one hand,
brief mood pictures, and on the other, a fiery romantic temperament
which expresses itself in rapid and at times abrupt alternations of feeling
from the gay to the melancholy, from the energetic to the pensive.
One of the most beautiful of the Mazurkas is that in A minor, op. 17,
no. 4 (1833), of which Stokowski made an excellent orchestral arrangement.
One of the most dramatic is that in B-flat minor, op. 24, no. 4
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
(1835) orchestrated by Stokowski, Auber, among others. Two other
Chopin Mazurkas that have been orchestrated are found in <i>Les Sylphides</i>
(see <a href="#sylph">below</a>): that in D major, op. 33, no. 2 (1838) and C major,
op. 67, no. 3 (1835).</p>
<p>Chopin wrote nineteen Nocturnes, each one a slow, poetic and atmospheric
piece of &ldquo;night music.&rdquo; &ldquo;Chopin loved the night,&rdquo; wrote James
Gibbons Huneker, &ldquo;and its soft mysteries, and his nocturnes are true
night pieces, some with agitated, remorseful countenance, others seen
in profile only, while many others are whisperings at the dusk.&rdquo; The
most celebrated of Chopin&rsquo;s Nocturnes is that in E-flat major, op. 9,
no. 2 (1833), truly a &ldquo;whispering at the dusk.&rdquo; This is a beautiful,
romantic song that begins without preliminaries. As this spacious
melody unfolds, it acquires even new facets of beauty through the most
exquisite embellishments. Among the many transcriptions that have
become popular, besides those for orchestra, is one for violin and piano
by Pablo de Sarasate, and another for cello and piano by David Popper.</p>
<p>There are two Chopin Polonaises that are particularly favored by
audiences everywhere. One is the <i>Heroic</i>, the other the <i>Military</i>.
Chopin was especially successful in endowing artistic dimensions and
significance to this old courtly folk dance which is technically characterized
by its syncopations and accents on the half beat. He wrote twelve
for piano. The <i>Heroic</i>, in A-flat major, op. 53, no. 6 (1842) is fiery
music, its first robust theme being the reason why the entire work has
been designated as &ldquo;heroic.&rdquo; This main melody was borrowed for the
American popular song, &ldquo;Till the End of Time,&rdquo; a big hit in 1945.
(Sigmund Spaeth has pointed up the interesting fact that while &ldquo;Till
the End of Time&rdquo; was at the head of the &ldquo;Hit Parade&rdquo; in 1945, the
polonaise itself from which this song was derived was in fifteenth place,
&ldquo;competing with all the light and serious music of the world.&rdquo; And one
of the reasons why the Polonaise suddenly became so popular was because
it was featured prominently in the screen biography of Chopin
released that year, <i>A Song to Remember</i>.) The <i>Military Polonaise</i>, in
A major, op. 40, no. 1 (1839) is one of Chopin&rsquo;s most commanding pieces
of music. Both principal themes have a pronounced military character,
though the second is somewhat more subdued and lyrical than the first.
Glazunov&rsquo;s transcription for orchestra, for the ballet <i>Chopiniana</i>, is
one of several adaptations.</p>
<p>Of Chopin&rsquo;s twenty-six Preludes, two should be singled out for their
enormous popular appeal. Chopin&rsquo;s Preludes are brief compositions
suggesting a mood or picture, but at the end leaving the impression
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
with the listener that much more could be spoken on that subject.
These Preludes, as Robert Schumann wrote, &ldquo;are sketches, the beginnings
of studies, or, if you will, ruins; eagles&rsquo; pinions, wild and motley
and pell-mell. But in every piece we find, in his own pearly handwriting,
&lsquo;this is by Frederic Chopin&rsquo;; even in his pauses we recognize him
by his agitated breathing.&rdquo; There are twenty-four pieces in op. 28
(1839), each one in one of the keys of the major or minor scale, beginning
with C major and A minor, and concluding with F major and D
minor. The most popular is that in A major, one of the shortest in the
group, a sixteen-bar melody in two short sentences; this is not only one
of Chopin&rsquo;s simplest lyrical thoughts, but also one of his most eloquent.
Among the orchestral transcriptions is the one found in the ballet <i>Les
Sylphides</i> (see <a href="#sylph">below</a>).</p>
<p>The second of Chopin&rsquo;s most popular Preludes is the so-called <i>Raindrop</i>,
in D-flat major, op. 28, no. 15. Some of the depression experienced
by Chopin during a miserable stay in Majorca with George Sand&mdash;where
he was plagued by illness, bad weather, and the antagonism and
suspicions of his neighbors&mdash;can here be found. The melody is a somber
reflection, through which is interspersed a repetitious figure that seems
to suggest the rhythm of falling raindrops, the reason why this piece
acquired its familiar nickname. The belief that Chopin was inspired to
write this music by listening to the gentle sound of falling rain on the
roof of his Majorca house is apocryphal.</p>
<p><i><span id="sylph">Les Sylphides</span></i>, one of the most popular works in the classic ballet
repertory, makes extensive use of some of Chopin&rsquo;s best-known compositions
for the piano, orchestrated by Stravinsky, Alexander Tcherepnine,
Glazunov, and Liadov. With choreography by Michel Fokine it
was first presented by Diaghilev&rsquo;s Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in Paris
on June 2, 1909 with Pavlova, Karsavina, and Nijinsky as principal
dancers. There is no story line to this ballet. In place of characters there
are only dancers dressed in long white dresses, and a danseur in black
and white velvet. In place of an actual plot there is only atmosphere
and mood. A subdued, introspective overture (Prelude in A major, op.
28, no. 7) leads to the rise of the curtain on an ancient ruin within a
secluded wood. Girls in white are transfixed in a tableau; then they begin
dancing to the strains of the Nocturne in A-flat, op. 32, no. 2. After
that come various dances to the following Chopin compositions: Waltz
in G-flat, op. 70, no. 1; Mazurka in C major, op. 67, no. 3; Mazurka in
D major, op. 33, no. 2; a repetition of the opening A major Prelude;
Waltz in A-flat, op. 69, no. 1, the <i>L&rsquo;adieu</i>; a repetition of the opening
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
A major Prelude; Waltz in C-sharp minor, op. 64, no. 2; Waltz in E-flat,
op. 18, the <i>Grande valse brillante</i>.</p>
<p>Chopin&rsquo;s fourteen waltzes are the last word in aristocratic elegance
and refinement of style; they are abundant with the most beguiling
lyrical ideas. Perhaps the best loved of all these waltzes is that in
C-sharp minor, op. 64, no. 2 (1847). The waltz opens without preliminaries
with music of courtly grace; two other equally appealing subjects
follow. The so-called <i>Minute Waltz</i>&mdash;in D-flat major, op. 64, no. 1&mdash;is
one of the shortest of Chopin&rsquo;s compositions for the piano. The
term &ldquo;minute&rdquo; does not refer to the sixty seconds supposedly required
for its performance (actually that performance takes less than a minute)
but to the French term, &ldquo;<i>minute</i>&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;small.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="small">Eric <b id="g_Coates">Coates</b></span></h2>
<p>Eric Coates, one of England&rsquo;s most highly esteemed and
widely performed composers of light music, was born in Hucknall,
England, on August 27, 1886. While attending the Royal Academy of
Music in London, where he specialized in the viola under Lionel Tertis,
he supported himself by playing in several of London&rsquo;s theater
orchestras. Upon graduating from the Academy, Coates became violist
with several string quartets, including the Hambourg String Quartet
with which he toured South Africa in 1908. From 1912 to 1918 he was
first violist of the Queen&rsquo;s Hall Orchestra. Meanwhile, in 1911 he realized
his first success as composer of light music when his <i>Miniature
Suite</i> was introduced at a Promenade Concert; after 1920 he devoted
himself almost completely to composition, producing ballets, rhapsodies,
suites, marches, and so forth, that were heard around the world.
In 1930, his valse-serenade <i>Sleepy Lagoon</i> achieved a phenomenal success
in London; with lyrics by Jack Lawrence and in a popular-song
arrangement by Dr. Albert Sirmay, it made in 1942 seventeen appearances
on the American &ldquo;Hit Parade,&rdquo; twice in first place. Coates appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
as guest conductor throughout the music world, visiting the
United States in 1946 and 1955, on both occasions conducting concerts
of his music over the radio networks. In 1957 he became president of
the British Light Music Association. He died in Chichester, England,
on December 21, 1957.</p>
<p>In <i>Four Centuries</i>, a suite for orchestra (1941), Coates created a four-movement
work, each of which was in a musical style of a different century.
The first movement is a fugue, the second pavane, the third
Valse, and the last is called &ldquo;Jazz.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>London Suite</i> (1932), for orchestra, is one of his best known works
inspired by the city dearest to his heart. As he himself wrote: &ldquo;My best
inspiration is to walk down a London street and a tune soon comes to
me. When I can think of nothing I walk down Harley Street and there
is a lamp post. Every time I catch sight of it a tune comes to my mind.
That lamp post has been my inspiration for years.&rdquo; The most celebrated
movement of his suite is the stirring &ldquo;Knightsbridge March,&rdquo;
one of the most popular marches by an Englishman, perhaps second
only in universal appeal to Elgar&rsquo;s <i>Pomp and Circumstance</i>. It has been
used as the theme music for a program on the BBC, and when first used
the radio station was swamped with over twenty thousand letters asking
for its identification. Two other highly familiar movements from this
suite are &ldquo;Westminster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Covent Garden.&rdquo; The former is a &ldquo;meditation,&rdquo;
introduced by the chiming of bells of the Westminster clock
and followed by tunes both gay and pensive suggesting different moods
of people strolling in London streets below. The second is a tarantella,
a lively dance recalling the fact that the famous opera house, Covent
Garden, has also distinguished itself for the performances of comic and
light operas.</p>
<p><i>The Three Bears</i> is a realistic tonal picture of the famous fairy tale
of Goldilocks and the three bears. An expressive <i>Andante</i> section is intended
to depict the query of the three bears, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been sitting in my
chair?&rdquo; In the gentle waltz section that follows, Goldilocks goes to
sleep in the small bear&rsquo;s bed. A vigorous fast section demonstrates how
the three bears discover Goldilocks and chase her wildly. They finally
give up the pursuit, go home in good humor, while Goldilocks returns
to her grandmother to tell her of her adventure that day.</p>
<p>In <i>The Three Elizabeths</i> (1944), Coates provides sensitive lyrical
portraits of three English queens, Queen Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen;
Elizabeth, the Queen mother, widow of King George VI; and Elizabeth
II.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c37"><span class="small">Peter <b id="g_Cornelius">Cornelius</b></span></h2>
<p>Peter Cornelius was born in Mayence, Germany, on
December 24, 1824. After studying theory with Dehn in Berlin from
1845 to 1852 he became a passionate advocate of the &ldquo;music of the
future&rdquo; as promulgated by Liszt and Wagner. It was Liszt who introduced
Cornelius&rsquo; comic opera, <i>The Barber of Bagdad</i>, in Weimar in
1858; Liszt was finally forced to resign his conducting post in Weimar
because of the hostility of the audiences to this masterwork. From 1865
on Cornelius lived in Munich where he was reader to King Ludwig II
and professor of harmony at the Royal Conservatory. He died in
Mayence on October 26, 1874. He was a composer of operas and songs,
but is today remembered almost exclusively for <i>The Barber of Bagdad</i>,
one of the most delightful comic operas in the German repertory.</p>
<p><i>The Barber of Bagdad</i> (<i>Der Barbier von Bagdad</i>)&mdash;whose world premi&egrave;re
took place in Weimar on December 15, 1858, Liszt conducting&mdash;has
an amusing text written by the composer himself. The plot concerns
a rendezvous between Nureddin and Margiana, daughter of the
Caliph; Nureddin&rsquo;s friend, the barber of Bagdad, stands guard. This
amatory adventure is brightened by a series of episodes and accidents in
which Nureddin (mistaking his friend for the Caliph) seeks refuge in
a chest in which he almost suffocates. All turns out well in the end. The
Caliph offers his parental blessings to Nureddin and Margiana.</p>
<p>The overture is famous. Its main melody is a chromatic Oriental subject
which represents the barber. Another significant episode is the
theme with which the overture opens: a tender melody for woodwind
and muted strings. These two ideas, and several subsidiary ones derived
from the opera score, are developed with considerable good humor and
merriment until a dramatic conclusion is realized in the coda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="small">Noel <b id="g_Coward">Coward</b></span></h2>
<p>Noel Coward, one of England&rsquo;s most brilliant and versatile
men of the theater in the 20th century, was born in Teddington, on
December 16, 1899. He made his stage debut in 1911 in a fairy play,
and for the next few years appeared regularly in various other productions.
His career as performer was interrupted by military service during
World War I. After the war he decided upon a career as writer. His
first major success came with the play <i>The Vortex</i>, in 1924. From then
on he wrote dramas and comedies which placed him in the front rank
of contemporary playwrights. But his achievements in the theater do
not end here. He has also distinguished himself as an actor, night-club
entertainer, producer, lyricist, composer, and on occasion even as a
conductor. He wrote the texts, lyrics, and the music to several musical
productions, the most famous of which is the operetta, <i>Bitter Sweet</i>, in
1929. Other musicals by Coward include <i>Year of Grace</i> (1928), <i>Words
and Music</i> (1932), <i>Conversation Piece</i> (1934) and <i>After the Ball</i> (1954).
Out of some of these have come such celebrated Coward songs as &ldquo;Mad
About the Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mad Dogs and Englishmen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Some Day I&rsquo;ll Find
You&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Follow My Secret Heart.&rdquo; An anthology of fifty-one
Noel Coward songs from his various musical productions called <i>The
Noel Coward Song Book</i> was published in New York in 1953. Never
having received any musical training, Coward can play the piano only
in a single key, and must call upon the services of an amanuensis to get
his melodies down on paper.</p>
<p><i>Bitter Sweet</i> is his most famous musical, first produced in London on
July 18, 1929, and in New York on November 5, 1929. It was twice
adapted for motion-pictures, the first time in 1933 in England, and the
second time in 1940 in the United States in a production starring
Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. In <i>Bitter Sweet</i>, Noel Coward
made a conscious effort at writing a romantic, sentimental, nostalgic
operetta in the style so long favored in Vienna; indeed it was a hearing
of a recording of Johann Strauss&rsquo; <i>Die Fledermaus</i> that proved to be the
immediate stimulus in the writing of his text. The setting is for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
most part Vienna, and the time the 1880&rsquo;s. Sari, an English girl, is about
to marry an English man of means when she suddenly decides to elope
with Carl, a music teacher. They go to live in Vienna. Carl comes to his
sudden death in a duel, after which Sari continues to live in Vienna
where she becomes a famous singer. In her old age, after an absence of
half a century, she returns to London.</p>
<p>Three melodies from <i>Bitter Sweet</i> have become extremely popular.
The first is a nostalgic waltz, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll See You Again,&rdquo; from the first act,
the love song of Sari and Carl; the song recurs again in the third act,
and its closing measures serve to bring the play to a dramatic conclusion.
&ldquo;Zigeuner,&rdquo; also sung by Sari is, as its name suggests, in the gypsy
style so favored by the Viennese public. The third famous melody from
<i>Bitter Sweet</i> is &ldquo;If Love Were All.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Follow My Secret Heart&rdquo; comes from <i>Conversation Piece</i>, first
produced in London on February 16, 1934, and in New York the same
fall. The setting of this sentimental and nostalgic operetta is the English
resort town of Brighton in 1811 where Paul, a duke turned adventurer,
and Melanie, a Parisian chanteuse, are involved in a stormy romance
that ends happily. As sung by Yvonne Printemps in London, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Follow
My Secret Heart&rdquo; was the pivot on which the story rotated, and the main
reason for this operetta&rsquo;s enormous success.</p>
<h2 id="c39"><span class="small">C&eacute;sar <b id="g_Cui">Cui</b></span></h2>
<p>C&eacute;sar Cui was born in Vilna, Russia, on January 18, 1835. He
was graduated as an engineer from the St. Petersburg Engineering
Academy in 1857; following that he served for many years as a topographer,
as an authority on fortifications, and as an engineering professor.
All the while his principal avocation was music, which he had studied
from childhood on. Between 1864 and 1900 he was active as music
critic for various Russian newspapers and journals. As a composer, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
belonged to the nationalist group known as the &ldquo;Russian Five&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Mighty Five,&rdquo; but unlike his distinguished colleagues (Balakirev,
Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky and Borodin) his influence proved far
greater than his music. He wrote many operas and large orchestral
works, but none have remained alive in the repertory. He was probably
at his best in miniature for the piano, and in his songs. He died in
St. Petersburg on March 24, 1918.</p>
<p>It is with one of his miniatures that his name is still remembered.
This piece is the <i>Orientale</i>, a composition originally for violin and
piano, the ninth number in a suite of twenty-four pieces collectively
entitled <i>Kaleidoscope</i>, op. 50. The principal melody is in oriental style,
introduced and then accompanied by a persistent rhythm (which in
the original version is produced by plucked strings, while the melody
itself is first given by the piano. This melody is soon taken over by
the violin.) Transcriptions for orchestra have made this a salon favorite.</p>
<h2 id="c40"><span class="small">Claude <b id="g_Debussy">Debussy</b></span></h2>
<p>Achille-Claude Debussy, father of musical Impressionism,
was born in St. Germain-en-Laye, France, on August 22,
1862. From 1873 to 1884 he attended the Paris Conservatory where he
was both a rebellious and a brilliant student. He won many prizes, including
the Prix de Rome in 1884. In the compositions written in
Rome under the provisions of the Prix he already revealed his independence
of thought and unorthodoxy of style. After returning from
Rome to Paris he became influenced not only by the Impressionist
movement in French art and the Symbolist movement in French literature
but also by the iconoclastic musical approaches and idioms of Erik
Satie. Debussy now began to develop his own techniques and mannerisms
and to crystallize his highly personal style. His first masterworks
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
appeared between 1892 and 1893: the orchestral prelude, <i>The Afternoon
of a Faun</i> (<i>L&rsquo;Apr&egrave;s-midi d&rsquo;un faune</i>), and his string quartet. With
later works for orchestra and for solo piano&mdash;and with his remarkable
opera, <i>Pelleas and Melisande</i>, introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique on
April 30, 1902&mdash;he brought musical Impressionism to its highest technical
development and to its most advanced stage of artistic fulfillment.
He became the musical poet of the most subtle suggestions, elusive
moods, and delicate impressions. A victim of cancer, Debussy suffered
severely in the closing years of his life. He died in Paris on March 25,
1918, on a day when the city was being bombarded by the Germans
during World War I. Because of the war, his death passed unnoticed
except by a handful of friends.</p>
<p>Debussy&rsquo;s greatest works are, to be sure, too complex in technique
and too subtle in style to enjoy ready consumption by the general public.
But a few of his compositions have a wide appeal because their
charm and sensitivity are easily comprehended, even at first hearing.
One of these is the delightful piano suite, <i>Children&rsquo;s Corner</i> (1908)
written by the composer for the delight of his little daughter, Chou-Chou.
In it Debussy evokes the imaginative world of the child; but
he also produces unsophisticated descriptive music that is readily appreciated
by the very young. Debussy used English rather than French
titles for this work because he wished to suggest the kind of stories and
games that involve an English governess and a French child. Andr&eacute;
Caplet&rsquo;s orchestration of this suite is famous.</p>
<p>There are six brief movements. The first, &ldquo;Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum,&rdquo; is
a satire on young pianists and their struggles with five-finger exercises.
This is followed by &ldquo;Jimbo&rsquo;s Lullaby,&rdquo; a tender lullaby crooned by a
child to his toy elephant named Jimbo. In the third movement, &ldquo;Serenade
for a Doll,&rdquo; the child turns from his pet elephant to his pet doll
to croon to it a sensitive serenade. &ldquo;The Snow Is Falling&rdquo; is a tone
picture of a snowfall, seen by a child from his window. &ldquo;The Little
Shepherd&rdquo; is a pastoral piece of music. The most famous movement of
the suite is the last one, &ldquo;Golliwogg&rsquo;s Cakewalk&rdquo; in which the composer
exploits the style and rhythm of a Negro dance popular in America in
the 19th century, the cakewalk. In this movement, the composer maliciously
interpolates a fragment from the Prelude of Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Tristan
and Isolde</i>.</p>
<p>The beloved <i>Clair de Lune</i> (<i>Moonlight</i>) is probably the composer&rsquo;s
most celebrated melody. This is a poetic, sensitive evocation of the
peace and beauty of a moonlight light. It comes from his <i>Suite bergamasque</i>
for piano (1890), where it can be found as the third of four
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
movements. Orchestral transcriptions have made this piece of music
world-famous.</p>
<p><i>The Girl With the Flaxen Hair</i> (<i>La Fille aux cheveux de lin</i>) is an
exquisite portrait, in the composer&rsquo;s most felicitous impressionist style.
It is the eighth number of his Preludes for the piano, Book I (1910),
and like <i>Clair de lune</i> is often heard in various orchestral transcriptions;
Arthur Hartmann&rsquo;s adaptation for violin and piano is also
familiar.</p>
<p>The <i>Petite Suite</i> (<i>Little Suite</i>) for piano duet (1889) is early Debussy,
more in the Romantic vein of Delibes than in the provocative idiom
Debussy later made famous. As orchestrated by Henri Busser it is in the
repertory of many salon and pop orchestras. There are four short movements.
The first, &ldquo;<i>En Bateau</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>In a Boat</i>&rdquo;) is particularly popular. In
the orchestration a gentle barcarolle melody for flute suggests the gentle
course of the boat in a placid lake. This is followed by turns by a vigorous
episode and a passionate section, both of them for the strings. The
flute then restores placidity, and the opening sensitive melody returns
in the violins. &ldquo;<i>Cort&egrave;ge</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;March&rdquo;) is a pert little march tune shared
by the woodwind and strings. &ldquo;<i>Menuet</i>&rdquo; is of classic grace while the
finale, &ldquo;<i>Ballet</i>,&rdquo; has a compelling rhythmic vigor.</p>
<p><i>R&ecirc;verie</i> (1890) is a brief, atmospheric piece for the piano which has
became a favorite with Americans because in 1938 it was adapted into
the popular song, &ldquo;My Reverie.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c41"><span class="small">L&eacute;o <b id="g_Delibes">Delibes</b></span></h2>
<p>L&eacute;o Delibes was born in St. Germain-du-Val, France, on February
21, 1836. After attending the Paris Conservatory from 1848 on, he
became an accompanist for the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique and organist of the
Church of St.-Jean et St.-Fran&ccedil;ois in Paris in 1853. Between 1855 and
1865 he wrote a dozen operas, none of them successful. In 1865 he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
appointed chorusmaster of the Grand Op&eacute;ra where he was encouraged
to write music for ballet; the first of these was <i>La Source</i> in 1866 (renamed
<i>Naila</i> when later given in Vienna). His most successful ballets
were <i>Copp&eacute;lia</i> in 1870 and <i>Sylvia</i> in 1876, both still vital in the repertory.
In 1873 his most important op&eacute;ra-comique, <i>Le Roi l&rsquo;a Dit</i>, was
introduced by the Op&eacute;ra-Comique; Delibes&rsquo; most important opera,
<i>Lakm&eacute;</i>, was first performed on April 14, 1883 by the Paris Op&eacute;ra. Meanwhile,
in 1881, Delibes was appointed professor of composition at the
Conservatory. Three years after that he became a member of the French
Academy. He died in Paris on January 16, 1891.</p>
<p>Delibes is often described as the creator of modern ballet music. He
was the first composer to write symphonically for the dance, to bring to
ballet music the fullest creative and technical resources of the skilled
serious composer. Thus he opened a new field of compositions which
later composers (Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, and Ravel among many
others) cultivated with fertility. The elegance of Delibes&rsquo; style, the
caressing warmth of his lyricism, the richness of his harmonic and
rhythmic language, the delicacy of his orchestration endow his ballet
music with interest even when it is divorced from its choreography.</p>
<p><i>Copp&eacute;lia</i> is a staple in the classic ballet repertory. It was introduced
at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on May 25, 1870, choreography by A. Saint-L&eacute;on,
and scenario by C. Nuitter and A. Saint-L&eacute;on based upon <i>The Sandman</i>,
a story by E. T. A. Hoffmann. <i>Copp&eacute;lia</i> is the first successful ballet
to utilize the subject of a doll become human. Copp&eacute;lia is a doll created
by Dr. Copp&eacute;lius. She comes to life and gets out of control. Franz, thinking
she is human, falls in love with her. But when he realizes she is but
a doll he becomes reconciled with his former sweetheart, Swanilda.</p>
<p>Delibes&rsquo; score is one of the earliest in ballet to make successful use
of such folk dances as the Mazurka and the Czardas; because of his success
in this direction, many later composers of ballet music were encouraged
to follow suit.</p>
<p>An orchestral suite adapted from the score never ceases to delight
audiences at both symphonic and semi-classical concerts. It opens with
the &ldquo;<i>Valse lente</i>,&rdquo; a suave waltz to which Swanilda dances as she strives
to attract the attention of Copp&eacute;lia, of whom she is jealous. This is followed
by the &ldquo;Mazurka,&rdquo; a gay episode danced by a group of villagers
after Franz has mistaken Copp&eacute;lia for a human and salutes her. The
&ldquo;Ballade&rdquo; then comes as a pensive interlude; to this music Swanilda
puts a stalk of wheat to her ear, following a long existing superstition,
to discover if Franz has been faithful to her. When the answer is in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
negative, she breaks the stalk savagely before his very eyes. &ldquo;<i>Theme
Slave Vari&eacute;</i>&rdquo; is danced by Swanilda; this section comprises a tuneful
Polish melody and five variations. The stately and at times fiery
&ldquo;Czardas&rdquo; which concludes the first act is a corybantic in which all villagers
join. &ldquo;<i>Valse de la poup&eacute;e</i>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Dance of the Doll&rdquo;) is probably
the most familiar musical number in the entire ballet, an elegant waltz
danced by Swanilda as she assumes the dress, and imitates the actions,
of Copp&eacute;lia.</p>
<p>The <i>Naila Waltz</i> (or <i>Pas des Fleurs</i>) was written by Delibes in 1867
as an intermezzo for the revival in Paris of Adolph Adam&rsquo;s opera <i>Le
Corsaire</i>, in Paris. When Delibes&rsquo; early ballet, <i>La Source</i>, was introduced
in Vienna as <i>Naila</i>, this waltz was interpolated into the production.
A short, vigorous introduction for full orchestra and several notes
in the basses lead to the lilting waltz melody in strings, with the woodwinds
soon joining in. Ernst von Dohn&aacute;nyi made an effective transcription
of this waltz for the piano.</p>
<p><i>Le Roi l&rsquo;a dit</i> (<i>The King Said So</i>) is an op&eacute;ra-comique with libretto
by Edmond Gondinet, introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in Paris on
May 24, 1873. The plot revolves around a peasant boy whom a Marquis
is trying to pass off before the king as his own son. The peasant makes
the most of this situation to the continual embarrassment and chagrin
of the Marquis who finally manages to get rid of him by marrying him
off to a maid with whom the boy is in love.</p>
<p>The popular overture to this light opera opens with a brisk march in
full chords. A gracious little melody then unfolds in the strings. After
a return of the march music in a more subdued vein, a romantic song is
offered by the clarinets against plucked strings. The music now grows
livelier as a principal thought is given by chattering strings and woodwind.
Extended use is now made of the first graceful melody. The opening
march is at last recalled to bring the overture to a boisterous end.</p>
<p>The second of Delibes&rsquo; famous ballets, <i>Sylvia</i>, was introduced at the
Paris Op&eacute;ra on June 14, 1876. The choreography was by Louis
M&eacute;rante, and the text by Jules Barbier and Baron de Reinach. The
classical subject is derived from mythology. Aminta, a shepherd, comes
to a sacred grove seeking a huntress he had once seen there. She is
Sylvia, who soon appears with her nymphs. She is later captured by
Orion, the black huntsman. But her escape is effected by Eros, and she
and Aminta are reunited in love.</p>
<p>Like <i>Copp&eacute;lia</i>, <i>Sylvia</i> has a popular orchestral suite adapted from
the ballet score. After a brief Prelude comes &ldquo;<i>Les Chasseresses</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Huntresses&rdquo;), sprightly music with which Sylvia and her nymphs make
their first appearance; to its rhythmic strains they dance before a statue
of Eros. A gentle &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; follows, describing the nymphs as they
rest near a stream. In the &ldquo;<i>Valse lente</i>&rdquo; Sylvia dances to a graceful
musical episode. The &ldquo;Barcarolle&rdquo; highlights a saxophone solo; to this
background music appears a ship bearing Eros, disguised as a pirate.
The most celebrated single number in the entire suite comes next, the
&ldquo;Pizzicato,&rdquo; a delicate dance performed by Sylvia disguised as a slave.
The &ldquo;<i>Cort&egrave;ge de Bacchus</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;March of Bacchus&rdquo;) is the dynamic music
with which a bacchanalian rite is being celebrated.</p>
<h2 id="c42"><span class="small">Gregore <b id="g_Dinicu">Dinicu</b></span></h2>
<p>Gregore Dinicu, who was born in Bucharest, Rumania,
on April 5, 1889, is a gypsy violinist who became popular in leading
Rumanian cabarets and restaurants. In 1939 he visited the United
States, scoring a major success with his gypsy orchestra at the New York
World&rsquo;s Fair. His <i>Hora Staccato</i>, for violin and piano (or violin and
orchestra)&mdash;a virtuoso piece of folk character&mdash;is his only composition to
become famous outside Rumania. Jascha Heifetz, the famous virtuoso,
heard Dinicu play it in Rumania and was so delighted with it that he
transcribed it, and popularized it both at his concerts and on records.
The Hora is an exciting Rumanian folk dance with lively rhythms and
a vertiginous melody that shifts flexibly from major to minor or modal
scales. These traits are all found in Dinicu&rsquo;s electrifying <i>Hora Staccato</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c43"><span class="small">Gaetano <b id="g_Donizetti">Donizetti</b></span></h2>
<p>Gaetano Donizetti was born in Bergamo, Italy, on
November 29, 1797. His early music study took place in Bergamo and
Naples and was completed at the Liceo Filarmonico in Bologna. Despite
his strong bent not only for music but also for art, literature, and architecture,
he aspired for a military career. While serving in the Austrian
army he completed his first opera, <i>Enrico di Borgogna</i>, introduced in
Venice in 1818. Success came four years after that in Rome with
<i>Zoraide di Granata</i>. Now exempted from further military duty, Donizetti
was able to devote himself entirely to composition. Between 1822
and 1829 he wrote twenty-three operas. In 1830 he achieved renown
throughout Europe with <i>Anna Bolena</i>, introduced in Milan. In the five
succeeding years he produced two masterworks by which he is still
represented in the operatic repertory: <i>L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;amore</i> in 1832 and
<i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i> in 1835. From 1837 to 1839 he was the director
of the Naples Conservatory. In 1839 he went to live in Paris where he
wrote and had produced several highly successful operas including <i>The
Daughter of the Regiment</i> and <i>La Favorita</i> in 1840 and <i>Don Pasquale</i>
in 1843. Soon after this he returned to his native city where he was
stricken by a mental disorder and for a time confined to an asylum. He
died in Bergamo on April 8, 1848.</p>
<p>The facility with which Donizetti wrote his sixty-seven operas is
apparent in the easy flow of his lovable melodies and in the spontaneity
of his aurally agreeable harmonies. He also possesses a fine theatrical
gift, and much of his best music combines delightful lyricism and affecting
emotion with dramatic force.</p>
<p><i>The Daughter of the Regiment</i> (<i>La Fille du r&eacute;giment</i>, or <i>La figlia
del reggimento</i>) was first performed at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in Paris on
February 11, 1840. The French libretto by Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Bayard and
Vernoy de Saint-Georges was translated into Italian by the composer.
The setting is Tyrol in 1815, then being invaded by Napoleon&rsquo;s troops.
Marie is the <i>vivandi&egrave;re</i> (canteen manager) of the 21st Regiment of the
French army. In love with Tonio, who is suspected by the French of
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
being a spy, she is able to prevail on the troops to save his life. But
Marie is soon compelled to be separated from both Tonio and the
French soldiers when it is discovered that she is the long lost niece of
the Countess of Berkenfeld and must return with her aunt to her castle.
The Countess wants Marie to marry the Duke of Crackenthorp. When
the French troops, with Tonio among them, storm the Berkenfeld castle
and want to reclaim Marie, the Countess now reveals that Marie is not
her niece but her daughter and thus must obey her wishes. However,
the French soldiers finally prevail on the Countess to permit Marie to
marry Tonio.</p>
<p>The most popular selections from this tuneful, and occasionally
martially stirring opera are: Marie&rsquo;s moving tribute to her regiment
(&ldquo;<i>Ah, chacun le sait, chacun le dit</i>&rdquo;) and her tender farewell as she is
about to leave for Berkenfeld (&ldquo;<i>Il faut partir, mes bons compagnons</i>&rdquo;)
and a spirited French war song to victory (&ldquo;<i>Rataplan</i>&rdquo;) all from the first
act; and from the second act, Marie&rsquo;s moving aria (&ldquo;<i>Par le rang, et
l&rsquo;opulence</i>&rdquo;), the orchestral entr&rsquo;acte &ldquo;<i>Tyrolienne</i>,&rdquo; and the dramatic
paean to France (&ldquo;<i>Salut &agrave; la France</i>&rdquo;) with which the opera ends.</p>
<p><i>Don Pasquale</i> is a classic in the literature of opera buffa. It received
its premi&egrave;re in Paris on January 3, 1843; its libretto (by the composer
and Giacomo Ruffini) is based on a libretto created by Angelo Anelli for
another opera. The central character is an old bachelor who objected to
the marriage of his young nephew with a beautiful widow, Norina. To
teach him a lesson, Norina puts on a disguise, involves the old man in
a mock marriage, and then tortures him with her shrewish ways. Pasquale
finally becomes so relieved to discover that he has merely been
the victim of an intrigue, rather than a catastrophic marriage, that he
does not hesitate any longer to give Norina and his nephew his consent
to their marriage.</p>
<p>In the case of <i>Don Pasquale</i> its overture is heard far more often than
potpourris of principal sections. It opens with heavy descending chords
which lead into an opulent song for cellos, soon assumed by horns and
the woodwind. The heart of the overture is a saucy melody for strings.
The music now becomes dramatized with transitional material, but a
new gay melody is offered by the woodwind and strings. The main
string melody and the succeeding sprightly tune are recalled to finish
the overture in a gay mood.</p>
<p><i>L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;amore</i> (<i>The Elixir of Love</i>) like <i>Don Pasquale</i>, is a delightful
comic opera, one of the most effervescent ever written. It received
its first performance in Milan on May 12, 1832. The libretto, by Felice
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Romani, was based on Eug&egrave;ne Scribe&rsquo;s <i>Le Philtre</i>. Nemorino, in love
with Adina who rejects him, purchases a love elixir from the quack,
Dr. Dulcamara. But a sudden inheritance from his uncle, which forthwith
makes Nemorino extremely popular with the girls, proves even
more potent in winning Adina&rsquo;s love than the potion itself.</p>
<p>Orchestral selections from his gay opera include one of the best loved
tenor arias in the operatic repertory. It is &ldquo;<i>Una furtiva lagrima</i>,&rdquo; a soulful
song by Nemorino in the second act with which he hopes to console
Adina when he sees her jealousy suddenly aroused by the fact that he
had become the favorite of the village girls. Other familiar episodes
include a merry comic number &ldquo;<i>Udite, Udite</i>&rdquo; in which Dr. Dulcamara
boasts of the power of his potions, and a beautiful aria, &ldquo;<i>Quanto
&egrave; bella</i>,&rdquo; in which Nemorino discloses his love and longing for Adina,
both in the first act.</p>
<p><i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i> is Donizetti&rsquo;s most famous grand opera, and
the title role has been favored by the world&rsquo;s foremost coloratura
sopranos. The libretto, by Salvatore Cammarano, was based on the Sir
Walter Scott romance, <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>. The opera was first
performed in Naples on September 26, 1835. Lucia, sister of Lord
Ashton, is in love with Edgar; but in planning to have her marry the
wealthy Lord Arthur Bucklaw, Lord Ashton uses lies and wiles to convince
his sister that Edgar does not love her. On the day of the signing
of the marriage contract between Lucia and Bucklaw, Edgar invades
the Lammermoor castle and curses its family. Maddened by her grief,
Lucia kills her husband soon after the wedding, and then dies. When
Edgar learns that Lucia has loved him all the time, he commits suicide.</p>
<p>The favorite selections from this opera include one of the most
famous ensemble numbers in all opera, the sextet &ldquo;<i>Chi mi frena</i>.&rdquo; It is
sung in Act 2, Scene 2, by Lucia, Edgar, Bucklaw, Raimond, Ashton
and Alisa after Edgar had invaded the Lammermoor castle and witnessed
the signing of the marriage contract between Lucia and Bucklaw.
Each of the characters here gives voice to his or her personal reaction
to this dramatic situation: Lucia speaks of her despair at the
treachery of her brother; Edgar wonders why he does not commit an
act of vengeance; Lord Ashton is led to sympathy at his sister&rsquo;s despair;
Lucia&rsquo;s companion, Alisa, and Bucklaw hope that bloodshed might be
averted; and Raimond, a chaplain, invokes divine help.</p>
<p>Another highly popular excerpt from the opera offered in orchestral
potpourris includes Lucia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mad Scene&rdquo; from Act 3, Scene 2 (&ldquo;<i>Ardon
gl&rsquo;incensi</i>&rdquo;). Dressed in a white gown, Lucia appears and mistakes her
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
brother for her beloved Edgar, who she believes has come to marry her.
Then she entreats those around her to place a flower on her grave and
not to weep at her death (&ldquo;<i>Spargi d&rsquo;amaro pianto</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Several other selections often played include Lucia&rsquo;s lyrical cavatina
from Act 1, Scene 2 (&ldquo;<i>Quando rapita in estasi</i>&rdquo;) as she thinks of her
beloved Edgar; the love duet of Lucia and Edgar from the same scene
(&ldquo;<i>Verrano a te sull&rsquo;aure</i>&rdquo;); and the wedding music from Act 3, Scene 1
that precedes the &ldquo;Mad Scene&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>D&rsquo;immenso giubilo</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 id="c44"><span class="small">Franz <b id="g_Drdla">Drdla</b></span></h2>
<p>Franz Drdla was born in Saar, Moravia on November 28,
1868. He attended the Conservatories in Prague and Vienna, winning
at the latter place first prize in violin playing and the medal of the
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. After serving for several years as a
violinist in the orchestra of the Vienna Court Opera, he toured Europe
as a concert violinist. From 1923 to 1925 he lived in the United States,
making many concert appearances. He died in Bad Gastein, Austria,
on September 3, 1944.</p>
<p>Drdla&rsquo;s most famous compositions are slight but lyrical pieces for
the violin, of which he wrote over two hundred fifty. His most famous
composition is the <i>Souvenir</i>, with its familiar upward skip in the main
melody and its broad sentimental middle section in double stops. In
a similarly sentimental and gentle melodic vein (they might aptly be
described as instrumental songs) are the <i>Romance</i>, <i>Serenade in A</i>
(No. 1), and <i>Vision</i>. All are familiar to violin students, and to lovers of
light classics in transcriptions for orchestra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c45"><span class="small">Riccardo <b id="g_Drigo">Drigo</b></span></h2>
<p>Riccardo Drigo was born in Padua, Italy, on June 30,
1846. He first became famous as conductor of orchestral concerts at the
Imperial Theater in St. Petersburg. After World War I, he continued
his activities as conductor in his native city. He died there on October
1, 1930.</p>
<p>Drigo was the composer of ballets and operas, none of which have
survived. He is today remembered almost exclusively for two slight but
well loved items. One is the melodically suave <i>Serenade</i>, popular in
every conceivable transcription. It comes out of a ballet entitled
<i>I milioni d&rsquo;Arlecchino</i> (<i>Harlequin&rsquo;s Millions</i>) and consequently is
sometimes known as the <i>Harlequin&rsquo;s Serenade</i>. The other is <i>Valse
bluette</i>, an elegant waltz melody, which the composer originally wrote
for salon orchestra, but which is in the violinist&rsquo;s repertory by virtue
of a famous transcription.</p>
<h2 id="c46"><span class="small">Arcady <b id="g_Dubensky">Dubensky</b></span></h2>
<p>Arcady Dubensky was born in Viatka, Russia, on October
15, 1890. After being graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1909
he played the violin in the orchestra of the Moscow Opera. In 1921 he
came to the United States, where he later became a citizen. He served
as violinist of the New York Symphony Society, and after that of the
New York Philharmonic Orchestra, until his retirement in 1953.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Dubensky had written many works for orchestra, whose sound technique
and fresh approaches command respect. One or two of these are
of popular appeal without sacrificing sound musical values. Of particular
interest is the <i>Stephen Foster Suite</i> for orchestra (1940), in which
Dubensky quotes five Stephen Foster songs: &ldquo;My Old Kentucky Home,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Some Folks,&rdquo; &ldquo;I See Her Still in
My Dreams,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Camptown Races.&rdquo; The composer goes on to explain:
&ldquo;The first part represents to me a beautiful summer evening in
the country. From far away I hear a choir, coming gradually closer and
then fading into the distance. It sings to me the wonder song, &lsquo;My Old
Kentucky Home.&rsquo; The second part is built around &lsquo;Jeanie With the
Light Brown Hair.&rsquo; Here the melody is given to a tenor solo, with a
soft, gentle orchestral accompaniment beginning with a short introduction.
The last two parts are for orchestra. The fourth part centers
around the song &lsquo;I See Her Still In My Dreams.&rsquo; It is a dreamy song, and
I have given it the character of an intermezzo played by string orchestra,
muted. If this movement is played in slow tempo, and pianissimo, it
sounds not at all realistic but like the dream it portrays. The fifth part,
&lsquo;Camptown Races&rsquo; is the focal point of the suite. The theme is treated
in a number of different keys and always in a different character. Sometimes
it is delicate and graceful, and sometimes rude and robust, but
always it is gay.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c47"><span class="small">Paul <b id="g_Dukas">Dukas</b></span></h2>
<p>Paul Dukas was born in Paris, France, on October 1, 1865.
After attending the Paris Conservatory, where he won prizes in counterpoint
and fugue as well as the second Prix de Rome, he served as music
critic for several Parisian journals. From 1910 to 1912 he was professor
of orchestration at the Paris Conservatory, and from 1927 until his
death its professor of composition. His first successful work was a concert
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
overture, <i>Polyecute</i>, introduced in Paris in 1892. His Symphony in
C major, first heard in 1897, enhanced his reputation while his orchestral
scherzo, <i>The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice</i>, also introduced in 1897, made
him famous. Being exceptionally fastidious and self-critical, Dukas did
not produce many compositions, but the best of these are works so aristocratic
in technique and subtle in musical content that they make a
direct appeal only to sophisticated music lovers. These works include
the opera <i>Ariane et Barbe-bleue</i>, first performed in Paris on May 10,
1907; the ballet, <i>La P&eacute;ri</i>, introduced in Paris on April 22, 1912; and some
piano music. Towards the end of his life, Dukas destroyed several of
his earlier works deeming them unsuitable for survival. He was one of
France&rsquo;s most revered musicians. He was made Chevalier of the Legion
of Honor in 1906, and in 1918 elected a member of the <i>Conseil de
l&rsquo;enseignement sup&eacute;rieur</i> at the Paris Conservatory. He died in Paris
on May 17, 1935.</p>
<p><i>The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice</i> (<i>L&rsquo;Apprenti sorcier</i>), scherzo for orchestra
(1897), is Dukas&rsquo; most famous composition, the one that made him
known throughout the world of music. It is so witty, so vivid in its pictorial
writing that it has become a favorite of both the very young and
the mature. The program, which the music follows with amazing literalness,
comes from Goethe&rsquo;s ballad <i>Der Zauberlehrling</i> which, in turn,
was adapted from a famous folk tale. The story goes something like this:
An apprentice to a magician has come upon his master&rsquo;s secret formula
for turning a broom into a human being and making it perform human
tasks. The apprentice decides to try out this incantation for himself
while the master is away, and watches with amazement as the broom
acquires human powers. He orders the broom to fetch water, a command
meekly obeyed. Pail after pail of water is carried into the magician&rsquo;s
shop by the broom until the place is rapidly being inundated.
The apprentice now tries to arrest the water-fetching activity of the
broom, but he does not know the proper incantation to achieve this, or
to strip the broom of its human powers. In terror, the apprentice attacks
the broom with a hatchet. The broom, split into two brooms, now
becomes two humans performing the ritual of bringing water into the
den. In despair, the apprentice cries out for his master who arrives in
time to bring the broom back to its former inanimate state, and to
restore order.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of mystery and peace prevailing in the magician&rsquo;s
den is created in the opening measures with a descending theme for
muted violins, while different woodwinds give a hint of the principal
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
subject, a roguish tune describing the sorcerer&rsquo;s apprentice; this subject
finally appears in the double bassoon, and is then repeated by the full
orchestra. The call of trumpets suggests the incantation pronounced by
the apprentice; a brisk theme for bassoons against plucked strings describes
the parade of the broom back and forth as it brings the water;
and arpeggio figures in the orchestra depict the water itself. The music
then portrays the mounting terror of the apprentice as he is unable to
arrest the march of the broom. After an overwhelming climax, at which
point the apprentice splits the broom into two with a hatchet, the saucy
march tune is doubled to inform us that two brooms are now at work.
A shriek in the orchestra simulates the panic-stricken call of the apprentice.
After the master arrives and sets things in order, the music of the
opening measures is repeated to suggest that once again the magician&rsquo;s
den is pervaded by peace and mystery.</p>
<p><i>The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice</i> was made into an animated motion picture
by Walt Disney, the Dukas music performed on the sound track by
the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski; it was part of a program
collectively entitled <i>Fantasia</i> which came to New York on November
13, 1940.</p>
<h2 id="c48"><span class="small">Antonin <b id="g_Dvorak">Dvo&#345;&aacute;k</b></span></h2>
<p>Antonin Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was born in Muehlhausen, Bohemia, on
September 8, 1841. As a boy he studied the violin with the village
schoolmaster. He subsequently attended the Organ School in Prague.
After completing his studies, he played in various orchestras in Prague,
including that of the National Theater from 1861 to 1871 where he
came under the influence of Smetana, father of Bohemian national
music. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k first attracted interest as a composer with <i>Hymnus</i>, a
choral work introduced in 1873. Two years later he won the Austrian
State Prize for a symphony, and in 1878 he became famous throughout
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Europe with the <i>Slavonic Dances</i>. In 1883 he was appointed organist
of the St. Adalbert Church in Prague. From 1892 to 1895 he was the
director of the National Conservatory in New York. During this period
he was influenced in his compositions by the folk music of the American
Negro and Indian. From 1901 until his death he was director of the
Prague Conservatory. He died in Prague on May 1, 1904.</p>
<p>A prolific composer of operas, symphonies, chamber and piano music,
and songs, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k stood in the forefront of the Romantic composers
of the late 19th century and among the leading exponents of Bohemian
national music. He was gifted with an expressive melodic gift, a strong
and subtle rhythmic pulse, and an inventive harmonic language. Whatever
he wrote was charged with strong emotional impulses, whether he
used the style of Bohemian folk music or those of the American Negro
and American Indian.</p>
<p>The <i>Carnival Overture</i> (<i>Carneval</i>), written in 1891, is one of three
overtures planned by the composer as a cycle to portray &ldquo;three great
creative forces of the Universe&mdash;Nature, Life, and Love.&rdquo; A unifying
element among them was a melody intended to describe the &ldquo;unchangeable
laws of Nature.&rdquo; Eventually, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k abandoned this plan and published
the three overtures separately, calling them <i>In Nature</i> (<i>In der
Natur</i>), op. 91, <i>Carnival</i>, op. 92, and <i>Othello</i>, op. 93.</p>
<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k himself provided a description of the music of <i>Carnival Overture</i>.
He aimed to describe &ldquo;a lonely, contemplative wanderer reaching
the city at nightfall where a carnival of pleasure reigns supreme. On
every side is heard the clangor of instruments, mingled with shouts of
joy and the unrestrained hilarity of the people giving vent to their feelings
in songs and dances.&rdquo; The overture begins with a lively section portraying
the gayety of the carnival. A subdued melody in the violins
brings relaxation, but the hubbub soon returns. Another gentle episode
depicts a pair of lovers in a secluded corner; the principal melodic
material in this part is offered by the solo violin, and by the English
horns and flutes. The brilliant opening material returns. It is with this
spirit of revelry that the overture ends.</p>
<p>The <i>Humoresque</i> in G-flat major is the seventh in a set of eight
<i>Humoresques</i> for piano (1894). This delightful, elegant piece of music
in three-part song form has been transcribed not only for orchestra but
for every possible instrument or combinations of instruments, and is
undoubtedly the most popular composition by the composer. It was
Fritz Kreisler, the famous violin virtuoso, who helped make the work
so famous. Kreisler visited Dvo&#345;&aacute;k in 1903 and asked him for some
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
music. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k showed him a pile of compositions, most of it completely
unknown. Among these was the G-flat major <i>Humoresque</i>.
Kreisler transcribed it for violin and piano, introduced it at his concerts,
later recorded it, and made it universally popular. As we know it
today the <i>Humoresque</i> is not the way Dvo&#345;&aacute;k intended it to sound.
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k wanted it to be a light, whimsical piece of music, a &ldquo;humoresque,&rdquo;
in fast tempo. Kreisler transcribed it in a slower tempo and
more sentimental mood; and it is in this style that <i>Humoresque</i> is now
known and loved.</p>
<p>The <i>Indian Lament</i> is one of several compositions by Dvo&#345;&aacute;k influenced
by the idioms of American-Indian music. While serving as director
of the National Conservatory in New York, he paid a visit to the
town of Spillville, Iowa. There three Iroquois Indians visited him and
entertained him with authentic Indian music. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was so taken
with this strange and haunting lyricism, and the primitive rhythms,
that he wrote several major works incorporating these idioms. One was
a Sonatina in G major for violin and piano, op. 100 (1893). Its slow
movement is a delicate song embodying the intervallic peculiarities of
authentic American-Indian music. Fritz Kreisler edited this movement
and named it <i>Indian Lament</i>, the version in which it has become
famous. Gaspar Cassad&oacute; transcribed this movement for cello and piano.</p>
<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s <i>Largo</i> is the second movement of his Symphony No. 5 in
E minor better known as the <i>Symphony from the New World</i> (1893).
This is the symphony written by Dvo&#345;&aacute;k during his visit to the United
States as director of the National Conservatory. One of his students
was Harry T. Burleigh, who brought to his attention the music of the
Negro Spiritual. These melodies moved Dvo&#345;&aacute;k so profoundly that he
urged American composers to use the style, technique and personality
of these Negro songs as the basis for national American music. As if to
set an example, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k wrote several compositions in which his own
melodic writing was strongly influenced by the Negro Spiritual. The
most significant of these was his symphony, which received its world
premi&egrave;re in the United States (at a concert of the New York Philharmonic
Orchestra on December 15, 1893, Anton Seidl conducting). The
main spacious, poignant melody of the Largo movement&mdash;given by English
horn over string harmonies after a few preliminary chords&mdash;so
strongly simulates the personality of a Negro Spiritual that it was long
thought that Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was indulging in quotation. This is not true; the
melody is Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s own. Many transcriptions of this melody exist. One
is the familiar song, &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; Home,&rdquo; lyrics by William Arms Fisher (also
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
one of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s pupils); another is a composition for violin and piano
by Fritz Kreisler called <i>Negro Spiritual Melody</i>; a third is an adaptation
for salon orchestra by Sigmund Romberg.</p>
<p>This Largo movement has two other melodies besides the basic one
in the Negro-Spiritual style. One is heard in flute and oboe, and the
second in the oboe.</p>
<p>The <i>Scherzo Capriccioso</i>, in D-flat major, op. 66 (1883) is one of the
composer&rsquo;s liveliest and most dynamic larger works for orchestra, but
in an idiom that is neither Bohemian nor American. It is in two sections.
The first is the Scherzo, opening with an energetic subject for
horns that is a kind of a motto theme for the entire work. The principal
melody that follows is stated by full orchestra; after that comes a waltz-like
tune for violins. The second part of the composition, a trio, is introduced
by an expressive melody for English horn. A secondary theme
then comes in the strings and wind. The principal idea of the first section
now receives extended treatment before the second theme of the
second part returns in a modified form. The work ends with a coda in
which effective use is made of the opening motto subject.</p>
<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k achieved international fame for the first time with the first
set of eight <i>Slavonic Dances</i>, op. 46, published in 1878. He had been
recommended to the publisher Simrock by Brahms; it was the publisher
who suggested to Dvo&#345;&aacute;k that he write Slavonic dances similar to the
Hungarian dances which Brahms had made so popular. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k wrote
his first set for piano four-hands; but these instantly proved so successful
that Simrock prevailed on Dvo&#345;&aacute;k to orchestrate them. In 1886,
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k wrote a second set of eight <i>Slavonic Dances</i>, op. 72, once again
both for four-hand piano and for orchestra. Though the melodies and
harmonic schemes in all these dances are Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s, they have caught the
essence of the Slavonic folk song and dance, and to such a degree that
their authentic national character has never been questioned. Karel
Hoffmeister wrote: &ldquo;Something of the Slavic character speaks in every
phrase of them&mdash;the stormy high-spirited mood of the Furiants; the
whimsical merriment, the charm, the touch of coquettry, the ardent
tenderness of the lyrical passages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following are among the best known of these dances:</p>
<p>C major, op. 46, no. 1. A chord sustained through one measure is
followed by a whirlwind presto passage. After a sudden pianissimo we
hear a second rhythmic melody. Music of a more serene character appears
in flute and strings after a change of key. A force climax is
evolved to set the stage for the return of the opening whirlwind subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>E minor, op. 46, no. 2. A poignant melody is here contrasted with a
dynamic rhythmic section. Fritz Kreisler transcribed this dance for
violin and piano.</p>
<p>A-flat major, op. 46, no. 6. A dance melody with a strong rhythmic
impulse is the opening subject. Pianissimo chords lead to a new virile
subject, but there soon comes a decisive change of mood with two
expressive melodies. This dance, however, ends dynamically.</p>
<p>G minor, op. 46, no. 8. This is one of the gayest of the Slavonic
dances, alive in its electrifying changes of dynamics and tonality.</p>
<p>E minor, op. 72, no. 2. This is one of the best loved of all these dances,
a song of rare sensitivity and sadness, only temporarily alleviated by
the more optimistic music of the middle section. Fritz Kreisler transcribed
it for violin and piano.</p>
<p>A-flat major, op. 72, no. 8. Here, as in the preceding E minor dance,
the emphasis is on tender, elegiac song in strings. A dramatic middle
section provides some relief, but the gentle moodiness of the opening
section soon returns. Fritz Kreisler transcribed it for violin and piano.</p>
<p><i>Songs My Mother Taught Me</i> is one of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s most celebrated
songs. It is one of seven gypsy songs, based on Slavonic-gypsy folk
idioms, gathered in op. 55 (1880); the lyrics are by Adolf Heyduk. This
nostalgic, delicate melody has enjoyed numerous transcriptions, including
one for violin and piano by Fritz Kreisler, and another for cello
and piano by Alfred Gruenfeld.</p>
<h2 id="c49"><span class="small">Sir Edward <b id="g_Elgar">Elgar</b></span></h2>
<p>Sir Edward Elgar was born in Broadheath, near Worcester,
England on June 2, 1857. He studied the organ with his father, and
the violin with Adolf Pollitzer in London. In 1885 he succeeded his
father as organist of St. George&rsquo;s Church in Worcester. Two years after
his marriage to Alice Roberts, which had taken place in 1889, he withdrew
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
to Malvern where he lived the next thirteen years, devoted completely
to serious composition. Several choral works were performed at
various English festivals before Elgar achieved outstanding success, first
with the <i>Enigma Variations</i> for symphony orchestra, introduced in
London in 1899, and then with his oratorio, <i>The Dream of Gerontius</i>,
whose premi&egrave;re took place in Birmingham in 1900. From then on Elgar
assumed a position of first importance in English music by virtue of his
two symphonies, vast amount of orchestral, choral and chamber music,
and songs. He was generally regarded one of the most significant English
composers since Purcell in the 17th century. Elgar was knighted in
1904, appointed Master of the King&rsquo;s Music in 1924, and made a
baronet in 1931. He died in Worcester, England, on February 23, 1934.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to understand Elgar&rsquo;s enormous popularity. Together
with an elegant sense of structure and style, and a consummate
musicianship, he had a virtually inexhaustible fund of ingratiating
lyricism. His best works are conceived along traditional lines. They are
Romantic in concept, and poetic in content. These qualities&mdash;and with
them a most ingratiating sentiment&mdash;are also found in his semi-classical
pieces.</p>
<p>The <i>Bavarian Dances</i>, for orchestra, come from <i>The Bavarian Highlands</i>,
a set of choral songs based on Bavarian folk songs adapted by
Elgar&rsquo;s wife, Alice, and set for chorus with piano and orchestra, op. 27
(1895). Three folk tunes were subsequently adapted by the composer
for orchestra. Collectively called <i>Bavarian Dances</i>, the individual dances
were subtitled by the composer &ldquo;The Dance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lullaby,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Marksman.&rdquo; These dances were first introduced in London in 1897 and
have since enjoyed universal acceptance in some cases for their peasant
rhythmic vigor, and in others for their atmospheric charm.</p>
<p>The <i>Cockaigne Overture</i> (<i>In London Town</i>), for orchestra, op. 40
(1901) describes London &ldquo;as represented by its parks and open spaces,
the bands marching from Knightsbridge to Buckingham Palace, Westminster
with its dignified associations of Church and State,&rdquo; in the
words of Sir George Grove. The composer himself revealed he wanted
to portray in his music the sights witnessed by a pair of lovers as they
stroll through the city. The hubbub of the city is depicted in the opening
measures, following by an intensely romantic section highlighted by
a broad melody for strings, reflecting the feelings of the lovers as they
stop off momentarily to rest in a public park. They continue their walk,
hear the approaching music of a brass band, then enter a church where
organ music is being played. The lovers continue their walk. The animated
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
life of the city streets once again is reproduced, and the earlier
romantic melody telling of their emotional ardor for each other is
repeated.</p>
<p><i>In the South</i> (<i>Alassio</i>), a concert overture for orchestra, op. 50 (1904)
was written one Spring while the composer was vacationing in southern
Europe. This work reflects Elgar&rsquo;s intense love of Nature. The following
quotation appears in the published score: &ldquo;A land which <i>was</i> the
mightiest in its old command and <i>is</i> the loveliest; wherein were cast the
men of Rome. Thou are the garden of the world.&rdquo; The overture opens
with a gay tune for clarinets, horns, violins and cellos. It receives vigorous
treatment and enlargement before a pastoral section is given by the
woodwind and muted strings, a description of a shepherd and his flock.
The overture then alternates between stress and tranquillity, with great
prominence being given to the shepherd&rsquo;s melody. A viola solo then
leads to the recapitulation section.</p>
<p><i>Pomp and Circumstance</i> is a set of five marches for symphony orchestra,
op. 39. The composers wanted these marches to provide such
music with symphonic dimensions in the same way that dance music
(polonaise or waltz, etc.) acquired artistic stature at the hands of
Chopin, among others. The phrase &ldquo;pomp and circumstance&rdquo; comes
from Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Othello</i>. The five marches are in the keys of D
major, A minor, C minor, G major, and C Major. The first two were
written in 1901; the third, in 1905; the fourth in 1907; and the fifth in
1930. The most famous of these is the second in A minor, one of Elgar&rsquo;s
most frequently performed compositions, and music as often identified
with the British Empire as &ldquo;God Save the King.&rdquo; It opens in a restless,
vigorous vein and erupts into a spacious melody for strings which
Laurence Housman subsequently set to lyrics (&ldquo;Land of Hope and
Glory&rdquo;). Elgar once again used this same melody in his <i>Coronation Ode</i>
for King Edward VII in 1902. The opening brisk, restless music is recalled
after a full statement of the melody.</p>
<p>The first in D major has a vigorous introduction after which unison
strings come forth with a robust march tune. The opening introduction
is subsequently used as a transition to the trio in which a soaring melody
is set against a uniform rhythmic beat.</p>
<p>The fourth in G major, known as &ldquo;Song of Liberty,&rdquo; is also familiar.
Once again the opening consists of spirited march music, and once
again the heart of the composition is a broad and stately melody for the
strings. This melody receives extended treatment which culminates
with a rousing statement by the full orchestra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p><i>Salut d&rsquo;amour</i>, for chamber orchestra, op. 12 (1889) is a nostalgic and
sentimental piece of music in three-part song form that has become a
salon favorite. It is also famous in a transcription for violin and piano.</p>
<h2 id="c50"><span class="small">Duke <b id="g_Ellington">Ellington</b></span></h2>
<p>Edward Kennedy &ldquo;Duke&rdquo; Ellington was
born in Washington, D.C. on April 29, 1899. His career as a popular
musician began in his adolescence when he performed jazz pieces on the
piano in an ice-cream parlor in Washington, and after that formed his
own jazz group. In 1923 he came to New York where he soon thereafter
formed a jazz band which performed at the Kentucky Club in Harlem.
Discovered by Irving Mills, the publisher, Ellington was booked for the
Cotton Club where he remained several years and established his fame
as an outstanding exponent of real jazz&mdash;as pianist, conductor of his
orchestra, composer, and arranger. He has since joined the all-time
greats of jazz music, acclaimed in night clubs, on the Broadway stage
and Hollywood screen, over the radio, on records, and in triumphant
tours throughout the music world.</p>
<p>As a composer Ellington is famous for his popular songs (&ldquo;Mood
Indigo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sophisticated Lady&rdquo; and so forth) and short instrumental jazz
pieces (<i>Black and Tan Fantasy</i>, <i>Creole Rhapsody</i>, <i>East St. Louis
Toodle-oo</i>, etc.) All this falls within the province of either popular
music or jazz, and for this reason cannot be considered here.</p>
<p>Ellington has also produced a rich repertory of larger works for
orchestra which have a place in the permanent library of semi-classical
music in the same way that Gershwin&rsquo;s larger works do. Skilfully utilizing
the fullest resources of jazz techniques, styles, and idioms, Ellington
has created in these larger works an authentically American music. He
himself prefers to consider many of these works as &ldquo;Negro music&rdquo;
rather than jazz; nevertheless, in their blues harmonies, jazz colorations,
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
and melodic and rhythmic techniques these works represented jazz
music at its very best.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most distinguished of these symphonic-jazz works is
<i>Black, Brown and Beige</i>, an extended work which Ellington introduced
with his orchestra in Carnegie Hall, New York, in 1943, and which he
described as a &ldquo;tonal parallel of the Negro in America.&rdquo; The first movement,
&ldquo;Black,&rdquo; is a musical picture of the Negro at work, singing at his
labors on the docks and levees in the slavery period before the Civil
War. An alto saxophone solo brings on a plangent Spiritual, &ldquo;Come
Sunday.&rdquo; The second movement, &ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; represents the wars in
which Negroes have participated. A tenor solo sings an eloquent blues
of the unsettled condition of the Negro after the Civil War. The contemporary
Negro is the inspiration for the finale, &ldquo;Beige,&rdquo; utilizing
jazz idioms and styles in portraying the period of the Twenties, Thirties
and Forties. Many facets of Negro life are drawn in brief musical
episodes, including the Negro church and school, and the Negro&rsquo;s
aspiration towards sophistication. The work ends on a patriotic note,
prophesying that the Negro&rsquo;s place in the American way of life is secure.</p>
<h2 id="c51"><span class="small">Georges <b id="g_Enesco">Enesco</b></span></h2>
<p>Georges Enesco was born in Liveni, Rumania, on August
19, 1881. He studied the violin at the Conservatories of Vienna and
Paris, winning highest honors in both places. Following the completion
of his studies in 1899, he launched a successful career both as concert
violinist and as composer. For several years he was the court violinist
to the Queen of Rumania, besides making outstandingly successful appearances
on the concert stage throughout Europe. His debut as composer
took place in Paris before his sixteenth birthday, with a concert
devoted entirely to his own works. Success came in 1901 with his
<i>Rumanian Rhapsody No. 1</i>. Enesco also distinguished himself as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
conductor. When he made his American debut&mdash;on January 2, 1923
with the Philadelphia Orchestra in New York City&mdash;it was in the triple
role of violinist, conductor, and composer. After World War I, Enesco
divided his residence between Paris and his native Rumania while touring
the music world. He made his last American appearance in 1950
on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of his debut as violinist; once
again he appeared in the triple role of violinist, conductor and composer.
He suffered a stroke in Paris in July 1954 and died there on
May 4, 1955. After his death, his native village, and a street in Bucharest,
were named after him.</p>
<p>Enesco was Rumania&rsquo;s foremost twentieth-century composer. His
major compositions range freely over several different styles from
nationalism, to neo-classicism, to ultra-modernism. But the works with
which he first gained world fame, and which have since had the widest
circulation, are those in a national Rumanian style, with Oriental-like
melodies and propulsive rhythms all modeled after the exotic folk songs
and dances of the Rumanian gypsies.</p>
<p>In such a style are his two Rumanian rhapsodies for orchestra: No. 1
in A major, op. 11, no. 1 (1901); No. 2 in D major, op. 11, no. 2 (1902).
The first rhapsody is the one played more often. It opens with a languorous
subject for clarinet which is soon assumed by other woodwind,
then by the strings and after that (in a quickened tempo) by the full
orchestra. A passionate gypsy tune follows in the strings; and this is succeeded
by an abandoned dance melody in first violins and the woodwind,
and an Oriental-type improvisation in solo flute. Now the mood
becomes more frenetic, with a rapid succession of whirling folk-dance
tunes and rhythms that are carried to a breathtaking climax. Relaxation
finally comes with a gentle Oriental melody in clarinet, but this
is only a passing phase. The rhapsody ends in a renewed outburst of
vitality.</p>
<p>In comparison to the first, the second rhapsody is an emotionally reserved
piece of music. After a solemn declaration by the strings, there
comes an equally sober and restrained folk song in the strings. The dark
mood thus projected becomes further intensified with a theme for English
horn against tremolo strings and continues throughout most of the
rhapsody, except for a brief interpolation of a vigorous dance melody
by the solo viola.</p>

<p>Leo Fall was born in Olmuetz, Austria, on February 2, 1873.
The son of a military bandmaster, he early received music instruction
from his father. Then, after attending the Vienna Conservatory, he conducted
theater orchestras in Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne. An opera,
<i>Paroli</i>, was unsuccessfully produced in Berlin before Fall settled permanently
in Vienna to devote himself to the writing of those charming
operettas in an abundantly lyric vein and graceful, sophisticated manner
which the Austrian capital favored. His greatest successes were <i>The
Dollar Princess</i> in 1907, <i>The Rose of Stamboul</i> (<i>Die Rose von Stambul</i>)
in 1916, and <i>Madame Pompadour</i> in 1923. He died in Vienna on September
15, 1925.</p>
<p>Fall&rsquo;s most famous operetta is <i>The Dollar Princess</i> (<i>Die Dollarprinzessin</i>),
selections from which are often given on salon programs. <i>The
Dollar Princess</i>&mdash;book by A. M. Willner and F. Gruenbaum based upon
a comedy by Gatti-Trotha&mdash;was introduced in Vienna on November 2,
1907. Its first American performance took place on September 6, 1909 at
the Knickerbocker Theater in an adaptation by George Grossmith, Jr.
Some songs by Jerome Kern were interpolated into the New York production.
The &ldquo;dollar princess&rdquo; is the heroine of the operetta: Alice
Couder, pampered daughter of a New York coal magnate who goes in
pursuit of Freddy. When at a lavish party at the Couder mansion she
brazenly announces her intention of marrying Freddy without previously
consulting him, he leaves her in disgust, and goes off to Canada
where he becomes a successful business man. He cannot forget Alice,
however. He brings the Couders to Canada on a pretext of discussing
with the father a business deal, when he confesses his love to Alice, who
no longer is brazen or arrogant.</p>
<p>A Viennese operetta must by necessity have a major waltz number,
and <i>The Dollar Princess</i> is no exception; &ldquo;<i>Will sie dann lieben treu
und heiss</i>&rdquo; from Act 1, is the most important melody of the operetta.
When other selections from this operetta are given they invariably include
also the lilting title song from Act 2, and the seductive little duet
&ldquo;<i>Wir tanzen Ringelreih&rsquo;n hin einmal und her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c53"><span class="small">Manuel de <b id="g_Falla">Falla</b></span></h2>
<p>Manuel de Falla, Spain&rsquo;s most significant twentieth-century
composer, was born in C&aacute;diz on November 23, 1876. After studying
music with private teachers in his native city, and with J. Trag&oacute; and
Felipe Pedrell in Madrid, he completed in 1905 <i>La Vida breve</i>, a one-act
opera that received first prize in a competition for native Spanish
operas sponsored by the Academia de Bellas Artes. From 1907 to 1914
he lived in Paris where he absorbed French musical influences and
became a friend of Debussy and Ravel. In 1914 he was back in his native
land; from 1921 to 1939 he lived a retiring existence in Granada, devoting
himself to serious composition. He left his native land in 1939
because of his disenchantment with the Franco regime which he had
originally favored. Until his death on November 14, 1946, he lived in
seclusion in Alta Gracia, in the province of C&oacute;rdoba, in Argentina.</p>
<p>Falla&rsquo;s art is deeply embedded in the soil of Spanish folk songs and
dance. His major works, which number a mere handful, are all evocations
of the spirit of Spain in music which, though never a direct quotation
from Spanish sources, is nevertheless Spanish to the core in details
of melody, harmony, and rhythm. His principal works include a
harpsichord concerto, <i>Nights in the Gardens of Spain</i> (<i>Noches en los
jardines de Espa&ntilde;a</i>) for piano and orchestra, the ballet <i>El Amor brujo</i>,
and the opera <i>The Three-Cornered Hat</i> (<i>El sombrero de tres picos</i>).</p>
<p>In Falla&rsquo;s most effective national idiom are two popular Spanish
dances. The <i>Ritual Fire Dance</i> (<i>Danza ritual del fuego</i>) is the seventh
section from the ballet, <i>El Amor brujo</i> (1915). Trills with the searing
intensity of hot flame lead into a languorous Spanish melody for the
oboe, behind which moves an irresistible rhythm. This is followed by
a second subject more intense in mood, loudly proclaimed by unison
horns and after that repeated quietly by muted trumpets. Throughout,
this dance has an almost savage ferocity, the music continually punctuated
by piercing chords; the dance is finally brought to a frenetic conclusion.
The composer himself made a highly effective transcription of
this dance for solo piano, and Gregor Piatigorsky for cello and piano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The <i>Spanish Dance No. 1</i> comes from the second act of the opera,
<i>La Vida breve</i>, with which Falla first achieved recognition. An impulsive
rhythmic opening serves as the background for a bold and sensual
gypsy melody for horns and strings. The piece ends with rich chords
for full orchestra. Fritz Kreisler made a fine transcription of this dance
for violin and piano.</p>
<h2 id="c54"><span class="small">Gabriel <b id="g_Faure">Faur&eacute;</b></span></h2>
<p>Gabriel-Urbain Faur&eacute; was born in Pamiers, France,
on May 12, 1845. His music study took place in Paris with Niedermeyer
and Saint-Sa&euml;ns. After that he served as organist in Rennes and Paris,
and held the important post of organist at the Madeleine Church in
Paris from 1896 on. In 1896 he also became professor of composition at
the Paris Conservatory where, from 1905 until 1920, he was director. In
1909 he was elected member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux Arts, and in
1910 made Commander of the Legion of Honor. In the last years of his
life he suffered from deafness. He died in Paris on November 4, 1924.</p>
<p>Faur&eacute; was one of France&rsquo;s major composers, creator of a considerable
library of piano and chamber music as well as works for symphony
orchestra which included <i>Pelleas and Melisande</i>, a suite (1898) and the
<i>Ballade</i> for piano and orchestra (1881). His music is filled with classic
beauty, serenity, and a most delicate sensibility and thus makes an
appeal only to a highly cultivated music lover. But a few of his works
have such melodic charm and appealing moods that they cannot fail to
cast a spell even on the untrained listener.</p>
<p><i>Apr&egrave;s un r&ecirc;ve</i> is a song, the first in a set of three published as op. 7
(1885), lyrics by Romain Bussine. Exquisite in its sensitive lyricism,
this melody has become popular in many transcriptions, some for
orchestra, one for violin and piano by Mischa Elman, and another for
cello and piano by Pablo Casals.</p>
<p><i>Dolly</i> (1893-1896) is a suite of six pieces for children which the composer
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
originally wrote as a piano duet for Dolly Bardac, daughter of a
woman who later became Debussy&rsquo;s wife. Henri Rabaud orchestrated
this suite in 1906, and it was first performed in connection with a ballet
staged at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Arts in Paris. In this music the composer looks
back on childhood and the world of the child with poetic insight and
occasionally a gentle sense of humor; in this respect this suite is not unlike
<i>Children&rsquo;s Corner</i> of Debussy. It opens with &ldquo;Berceuse,&rdquo; a gentle
melody for the woodwind, which Jacques Thibaud arranged for violin
and piano. This is followed by &ldquo;Mi-a-ou,&rdquo; a little quartet for muted
trumpets. A flute solo dominates &ldquo;<i>Le Jardin de Dolly</i>,&rdquo; while &ldquo;<i>Kitty
Valse</i>&rdquo; is a light and vivacious waltz tune. In &ldquo;<i>Tendresse</i>&rdquo; the melody is
first heard in strings. A tranquil middle section presents the solo oboe
above a harp accompaniment. The closing movement, &ldquo;<i>Le Pas espagnol</i>&rdquo;
is gay and brilliant music that pays homage to Chabrier, composer
of <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Pavane</i>, for orchestra, op. 50 (1887) is music of stately, classic
beauty over which hovers the Hellenic spirit so often found in Faur&eacute;&rsquo;s
most significant works. Against an insistent rhythm, the flute offers the
haunting refrain of the Pavane. This dance melody is soon shared by
the other woodwind, after which it unfolds completely in violins and
the woodwind, other strings providing a rhythmic pizzicato accompaniment.
A transition in the strings then leads us back to the graceful mood
and the gentle lyricism of the Pavane melody.</p>
<p>The same subdued and classic repose we find in the <i>Pavane</i> distinguishes
another of Faur&eacute;&rsquo;s popular compositions, the <i>Sicilienne</i>, for
cello and piano, op. 78 (1898). Transcriptions for orchestra of this composition
are even more famous than the original version.</p>
<h2 id="c55"><span class="small">Friedrich <b id="g_Flotow">Flotow</b></span></h2>
<p>Friedrich Freiherr von Flotow was born
in Teutendorf, Mecklenburg, on April 26, 1812. He was descended
from a family that traced its nobility back several centuries. After studying
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
music in Paris with Anton Reicha and Johann Pixis between 1828
and 1830, he wrote his first opera, <i>Peter und Katharina</i>. Success came
first with <i>Alessandro Stradella</i> introduced in Hamburg in 1844, and
was solidified in 1847 with the opera by which he is still remembered,
<i>Martha</i>. From 1856 to 1863 he was Intendant of the Schwerin Court
Theater. He went into retirement in 1880 and died in Darmstadt, Germany,
on January 24, 1883.</p>
<p>The ebullient melodies with which Flotow flooded his operas made
him extremely popular in his day. This same joyous lyricism keeps the
overtures to <i>Alessandro Stradella</i> and <i>Martha</i> fresh in the orchestral
repertory.</p>
<p><i>Alessandro Stradella</i>&mdash;introduced in Hamburg on December 30, 1844&mdash;was
based on a romantic episode in the life of a 17th century opera
composer; the libretto was by Wilhelm Friedrich. Stradella elopes with
Leonora, whose guardian hires assassins to kill the composer. But
Stradella&rsquo;s singing has such an effect on the assassins that they are incapable
of murdering him. They let him go, and in the end the guardian
himself is moved to forgive the composer and sanction his union with
Leonora.</p>
<p>The overture opens with a solemn chant for the brass (Stradella&rsquo;s
song in the last act). Vigorous transitional material leads to a robust
song for full orchestra which is soon repeated expressively by the strings.
A sprightly tune for strings (the bell chorus of the second act) is given
prominent treatment and developed climactically. The mood now alternates
between lightness and gaiety with an occasional intrusion of a
strong dramatic effect.</p>
<p><i>Martha</i> received its premi&egrave;re in Vienna on November 25, 1847. The
libretto, by Friedrich Wilhelm Riese was based on a ballet-pantomime
by Vernoy de Saint-Georges. &ldquo;Martha&rdquo; is Lady Harriet in disguise as a
servant girl for the sake of an amusing escapade; and the opera is concerned
with her amatory adventures with Lionel, and that of her maid
with Plunkett, at the Richmond fair. The complications that ensue
when the men discover this deception are eventually happily resolved.</p>
<p>The overture begins with a slow introduction which leads into a
<i>Larghetto</i> section where considerable attention is paid to the main
melody of the quintet at the close of the third act, &ldquo;<i>Mag der Himmel
euch vergeben</i>.&rdquo; The tempo quickens as the lively country dances of
the opera are presented. A crescendo reaches towards a fortissimo restatement
of the main theme of the third-act quintet, and the overture
ends with a brief and energetic coda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Salon orchestras often present potpourris of this opera&rsquo;s main
melodies. Two are always dominant in such potpourris. &ldquo;The Last Rose
of Summer&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Qui sola, vergin rosa</i>&rdquo;)&mdash;an aria sung by the heroine in
the second act&mdash;is a melody familiar to all; it is not by Flotow, but from
an old Irish song, &ldquo;The Groves of Blarney,&rdquo; set to a poem by Thomas
Moore. The second famous melody from <i>Martha</i> is the beautiful tenor
aria from the third act, &ldquo;<i>M&rsquo;Appari</i>,&rdquo; in which Lionel expresses his grief
when he feels he has lost Martha for good.</p>
<h2 id="c56"><span class="small">Stephen <b id="g_Foster">Foster</b></span></h2>
<p>Stephen Collins Foster, America&rsquo;s foremost song
composer, was born in Lawrenceville, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
on July 4, 1826. He received no formal musical training. <i>Tioga Waltz</i>,
in 1841, was his first piece of music to get performed. About a year
after that, Foster published his first song, &ldquo;Open Thy Lattice, Love.&rdquo;
His initial success came with &ldquo;Oh, Susanna!&rdquo; for which he received only
$100. But &ldquo;Oh, Susanna!&rdquo; became so popular soon after its publication
in 1848 that it became the theme song (with improvised lyrics) of the
Forty Niners on their way to California. Beginning with 1848 he wrote
songs for Ed Christy&rsquo;s Minstrels&mdash;at first allowing some of them to
appear as Christy&rsquo;s own creations. It was within the context of the
minstrel show that such permanent Foster favorites as &ldquo;Camptown
Races&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Folks at Home&rdquo; were first performed. Both songs
were outstandingly successful and, because of a favorable contractual
arrangement with a New York publisher, Foster was earning handsome
royalties. Now feeling financially secure, Foster married Jane Denny
McDowell in 1850, a relationship that was unhappy almost from the
beginning. In 1860 Foster came to New York with the hope of furthering
his career as a composer. But by now he was virtually forgotten by
the public, and publishers paid him only a pittance for his last songs,
many of them mostly hack pieces. Always disposed towards alcohol,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
Foster now became a habitual drunkard, living in the most abject poverty
in a miserable room on the Bowery. He died at Bellevue Hospital
on January 13, 1864.</p>
<p>Foster was the composer of numerous songs which in various orchestral
arrangements are basic to the repertory of every salon or pop
orchestra. His greatest songs were inspired by the Negro; they are the
eloquent expressions of Northern sentiment about slavery in the South.
Foster&rsquo;s most famous Negro songs are: &ldquo;Old Folks at Home&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;Swanee River&rdquo;), &ldquo;Massa&rsquo;s in de Cold, Cold Ground,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Old Kentucky
Home,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Black Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Foster first wrote &ldquo;Old Folks at Home&rdquo; his inspiration was an
obscure Florida River by the name of &ldquo;Pedee.&rdquo; But while writing his
song he thought &ldquo;Pedee&rdquo; not sufficiently euphonious for his purpose.
He went to a map of Florida to find another river, came upon &ldquo;Suwanee&rdquo;
which he contracted to &ldquo;Swanee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foster was also successful in the writing of sentimental ballads. Here
his most important songs were &ldquo;Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair&rdquo;
(written for and about his wife), and &ldquo;Beautiful Dreamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides orchestral adaptations of individual songs, Foster&rsquo;s music is
represented on orchestral programs by skilful suites, or ingenious symphonic
transcriptions of individual songs, by other composers. Arcady
Dubensky&rsquo;s <i>Stephen Foster Suite</i> is discussed in the section on Dubensky,
and Lucien Caillet&rsquo;s <i>Fantasia and Fugue on &ldquo;Oh, Susanna!&rdquo;</i> in the
Caillet section. Other composers to make symphonic use of Foster&rsquo;s
melodies are: Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (<i>Humoresques on Foster
Themes</i>); Morton Guild (<i>Foster Gallery</i>); and Alan Shulman (<i>Oh,
Susanna!</i>).</p>
<h2 id="c57"><span class="small">Rudolf <b id="g_Friml">Friml</b></span></h2>
<p>Rudolf Friml was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on December
7, 1879. He received his musical training at the Prague Conservatory,
after which he toured Europe and America as assisting artist
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
and accompanist for Jan Kubelik, the noted violin virtuoso. In 1906,
Friml established permanent residence in the United States, making
several appearances as concert pianist, twice in the performance of his
own Concerto in B-flat. He now published piano pieces, instrumental
numbers, and songs which attracted the interest of two publishers, Gus
Schirmer and Max Dreyfus. When, in 1912, Victor Herbert stepped out
of an assignment to write the music for the operetta <i>The Firefly</i>, both
Schirmer and Dreyfus recommended Friml as his replacement. <i>The
Firefly</i> made Friml famous. Until 1934 he continued writing music for
the Broadway stage, achieving further triumphs with <i>Rose Marie</i> in
1924, <i>The Vagabond King</i> in 1925, and <i>The Three Musketeers</i> in 1928.
After 1934, Friml concentrated his activity on motion pictures in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Friml belongs with those Broadway composers of the early 20th century
whose domain was the operetta modelled after German and Austrian
patterns. As long as the operetta was popular on the Broadway
stage, Friml remained a favorite, for his ingratiating melodies, pleasing
sentimentality, winning charm, and strong romantic flair were in
the best traditions of the operetta theater. But when the vogue for
operettas died down and the call came for American musicals with
native settings and characterizations, realistic approaches, and a greater
cohesion between text and music, Friml&rsquo;s day was over. He has produced
nothing of significance since the middle 1930&rsquo;s, and very little
of anything else. But the music he wrote for his best operettas has
never lost its appeal.</p>
<p><i>The Firefly</i>, book and lyrics by Otto Harbach, was introduced in
New York on December 2, 1912. The plot concerned a little Italian
street singer by the name of Nina (enchantingly played by Emma Trentini).
She disguises herself as a boy to get a job aboard a yacht bound for
Bermuda, and is first accused and then cleared of the charge of being a
pickpocket. Many years later she reappears as a famous prima donna
when she is finally able to win the wealthy young man with whom she
had fallen in love while working on the yacht.</p>
<p>Orchestral potpourris from <i>The Firefly</i> always include three of the
songs Emma Trentini helped to make famous: &ldquo;Giannina Mia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Dawn of Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love is Like a Firefly.&rdquo; The melodious duet,
&ldquo;Sympathy,&rdquo; is also popular.</p>
<p><i>The Donkey Serenade</i>, now regarded as one of the favorites from
<i>The Firefly</i> score, was not in the original operetta when it was produced
on Broadway. Friml wrote it in collaboration with Herbert
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Stothart for the motion picture adaptation of the operetta released in
1937 and starring Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones. This appealing
Spanish-type melody is set against an intriguing rhythm suggesting the
jogging movement of a donkey; this rhythm precedes and closes the
number, which has become as celebrated in an instrumental version as
it is as a song with lyrics by Chet Forrest and Bob White.</p>
<p><i>Rose Marie</i>, book and lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein
II, came to Broadway on September 2, 1924 where it remained
for more than a year. The rest of the country became acquainted with
this lovable operetta at that time by means of four road companies. The
setting is the Canadian Rockies, and the love interest involves Rose
Marie and Jim, the latter falsely accused of murder. The Canadian
Mounted Police, headed by Sergeant Malone, help to clear Jim and to
bring the love affair of Rose Marie and Jim to a happy resolution. Selections
in orchestral adaptations most often heard from this operetta include
two of Friml&rsquo;s most famous songs, the title number and &ldquo;Indian
Love Call&rdquo;; a third delightful song was found in &ldquo;Totem Tom Tom.&rdquo;
<i>Rose Marie</i> was adapted for motion pictures three times, once in a
silent version.</p>
<p><i>The Vagabond King</i> had for its central character the French vagabond
poet of the 15th century, Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, who is made king for
a day. This musical was based on the romance of J. H. McCarthy, <i>If I
Were King</i>, adapted by Brian Hooker. <i>The Vagabond King</i>, which
opened on September 21, 1925, was one of Friml&rsquo;s greatest successes,
mainly because of such rousing numbers as &ldquo;The Song of the Vagabonds,&rdquo;
the caressing waltz melody &ldquo;Waltz Huguette,&rdquo; and the love
song &ldquo;Only a Rose,&rdquo; all often heard in orchestral adaptations. <i>The
Vagabond King</i> was made into motion pictures twice, most recently in
1956 starring Kathryn Grayson and Oreste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c58"><span class="small">Julius <b id="g_Fucik">Fuč&iacute;k</b></span></h2>
<p>Julius Fuč&iacute;k was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on July 18,
1872. He was a pupil of Antonin Dvo&#345;&aacute;k in composition. After playing
the bassoon in the German Opera in Prague in 1893, he became bandmaster
of the 86th and 92nd Austrian Regiments in which he won renown
throughout Europe. He died in Leitmeritz, Czechoslovakia, on
September 25, 1916. Fuč&iacute;k wrote numerous dance pieces and marches
for band. The most popular of these is the stirring march, <i>Entrance of
the Gladiators</i>, which became popular throughout the world and is still
frequently played by salon orchestras as well as bands.</p>
<h2 id="c59"><span class="small">Sir Edward <b id="g_German">German</b></span></h2>
<p>Sir Edward German was born Edward German Jones in
Whitchurch, England, on February 17, 1862. He attended the Royal
Academy of Music in London where, in 1895, he was elected Fellow.
Meanwhile, in 1888-1889 he became the musical director of the Globe
Theater in London. The incidental music he wrote there that year for
Richard Mansfield&rsquo;s production of <i>Richard III</i> proved so popular that
Sir Henry Irving commissioned him to write similar music for his own
presentation of <i>Henry VIII</i>. German subsequently wrote incidental
music for many other plays including <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (1895), <i>As You
Like It</i> (1896), <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> (1898) and <i>Nell Gwynn</i>
(1900). He also produced a considerable amount of concert music, including
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
two symphonies and various suites, tone poems, rhapsodies, and
a march and hymn for the Coronation of George V in 1911. German
was knighted in 1928, and in 1934 he received the Gold Medal of the
Royal Philharmonic Society. He died in London on November 11,
1936.</p>
<p>German is most famous for his incidental music for the stage. He
combined a graceful lyricism with a consummate skill in orchestration.
He also possessed to a remarkable degree the capacity of simulating the
archaic idioms of old English music of the Tudor and Stuart periods.
Thus the greatest charm of his writing lies in its subtle atmospheric
recreation of a bygone era; but a lightness of touch and freshness of
material are never sacrificed.</p>
<p>Of his incidental music perhaps the most famous is that for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Henry VIII</i>, introduced at the Lyceum Theater in London in
1892 in Sir Henry Irving&rsquo;s production. German&rsquo;s complete score consists
of an overture, five entr&rsquo;actes, a setting of the song &ldquo;Orpheus and
his Lute&rdquo; and other pieces. But what remain popular are three delightful
old English dances from the first act; the style and spirit of old
English music are here reproduced with extraordinary effect. The three
are: &ldquo;Morris Dance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s Dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Torch Dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best sections of his incidental music to Anthony Hope&rsquo;s <i>Nell
Gwynn</i>, produced at the Prince of Wales Theater in 1900, also are
revivals of old English dances: &ldquo;Country Dance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Merrymaker&rsquo;s
Dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pastoral Dance.&rdquo; Other delightful dances, often in an old
English folk style, are found in his incidental music to <i>As You Like It</i>
(&ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Dance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rustic Dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Woodland Dance&rdquo;) and
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (&ldquo;Pavane&rdquo; and &ldquo;Torch Dance&rdquo;).</p>
<p>German also wrote several operettas, the most famous being <i>Merrie
England</i>, text by Basil Hood, first performed at the Savoy Theater in
London on April 2, 1902. The setting is Elizabethan England, and the
plot involves the love affair of Sir Walter Raleigh and the Queen&rsquo;s Maid
of Honor which upsets Queen Elizabeth since she herself has designs on
Sir Walter. German&rsquo;s score is filled with the most delightful old world
jigs, country dances, glees, and melodies imitating the style of old-time
madrigals. In addition, there is here an impressive patriotic song (&ldquo;The
Yeomen of England&rdquo;), Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s effective air (&ldquo;O Peaceful England&rdquo;),
a rousing drinking song by Sir Walter Raleigh, a poignant ballad
by the Maid of Honor, and an equally moving love duet by the Maid of
Honor and Sir Walter Raleigh. Because of its effective music, rich with
English flavors, <i>Merrie England</i> has survived as one of the most popular
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
English operettas of the 20th century, and has often been revived in
London.</p>
<p>Among German&rsquo;s many concert works for orchestra one of the most
famous is the <i>Welsh Rhapsody</i> (1902). This is a skilful symphonic
adaptation of Welsh tunes, the last of which (&ldquo;Men of Larech&rdquo;) is
utilized by the composer to bring his rhapsody to a powerful culmination.
The other Welsh folk songs used earlier by the composer in this
rhapsody are &ldquo;Loudly Proclaim O&rsquo;er Land and Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hunting the
Hare,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bells of Aberdorry&rdquo; and &ldquo;David of the White Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c60"><span class="small">George <b id="g_Gershwin">Gershwin</b></span></h2>
<p>George Gershwin was born in Brooklyn, New York on
September 26, 1898. Though he received serious musical training in
piano from Charles Hambitzer, and in harmony and theory from Edward
Kilenyi, he early set his sights on popular rather than serious
music. When he was fifteen he found a job as song plugger and staff
pianist in Tin Pan Alley where he soon began writing songs. The first
to get published was &ldquo;When You Want &rsquo;Em You Can&rsquo;t Get &rsquo;Em&rdquo; in
1916; in the same year another of his songs, &ldquo;The Making of a Girl&rdquo;
appeared for the first time on the Broadway stage, in <i>The Passing Show
of 1916</i>. Gershwin&rsquo;s first complete score for Broadway was <i>La, La,
Lucille</i>, and his first smash song hit was &ldquo;Swanee,&rdquo; both in 1919. Between
1920 and 1924 Gershwin wrote the music for five editions of the
George White <i>Scandals</i> where he first demonstrated his exceptional
creative gifts; his most famous songs for the <i>Scandals</i> were &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Build a
Stairway to Paradise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Somebody Loves Me.&rdquo; For one of the editions
of the <i>Scandals</i> he also wrote a one-act Negro opera to a libretto
by Buddy De Sylva&mdash;originally called <i>Blue Monday</i> but later retitled
<i>135th Street</i>.</p>
<p>Late in 1923, Paul Whiteman, the orchestra leader, commissioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
Gershwin to write a symphonic work in a jazz style for a concert Whiteman
was planning for Aeolian Hall, in New York. That jazz composition&mdash;introduced
on February 12, 1924&mdash;was the <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> with
which Gershwin achieved world renown, and which once and for all
established the jazz idiom and jazz techniques as significant material for
serious musical deployment. From then on, until the end of his life,
Gershwin continued to write concert music in a popular style&mdash;growing
all the time in technical assurance, in the command of jazz materials,
and in the inventiveness of his melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic writing.
In the eyes of the world he assumed a position of first significance
among American composers. For the symphony orchestra he wrote the
Piano Concerto in F, <i>An American in Paris</i>, <i>Cuban Overture</i>, <i>Variations
on I Got Rhythm</i>, and the <i>Second Rhapsody</i>; for solo piano, the
three piano preludes; for the stage his monumental folk opera, <i>Porgy
and Bess</i>.</p>
<p>While devoting himself to the concert field, Gershwin did not neglect
the popular Broadway theater. He produced a library of remarkable
songs for such productions as <i>Lady Be Good</i> (1924), <i>Oh Kay!</i> (1926),
<i>Funny Face</i> (1927), and <i>Girl Crazy</i> (1930). The best of these included
&ldquo;Fascinating Rhythm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lady Be Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Someone to Watch Over
Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Clap Yo&rsquo; Hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;&rsquo;S Wonderful,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Got Rhythm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Embraceable
You,&rdquo; and &ldquo;But Not for Me.&rdquo; The lyrics for these and other
Gershwin song classics were written by his brother, Ira.</p>
<p>In 1930 Gershwin revealed a fresh bent for mockery and satire, together
with a new skill for more spacious musical writing than that
required for a song, in <i>Strike Up the Band</i>, a satire on war. These qualities
in Gershwin&rsquo;s music came to full ripeness in 1931 with the political
satire <i>Of Thee I Sing!</i>, the first musical ever to win the Pulitzer Prize
for drama.</p>
<p>In 1931, Gershwin wrote his first original score for motion pictures,
<i>Delicious</i>. When he returned to Hollywood in 1936 he settled there
permanently and wrote the music for several delightful screen musicals,
among these being <i>Damsel in Distress</i>, <i>Shall We Dance</i>, and <i>The Goldwyn
Follies</i>. The songs he wrote for the last-named revue (they included
&ldquo;Love Walked In&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love Is Here to Stay&rdquo;) were the last pieces of
music he was destined to write. He died in Hollywood, California on
July 11, 1937, a victim of a cystic tumor on the right temporal lobe of
the brain. His screen biography, <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>, was produced in
1945. In 1951, the screen musical, <i>An American in Paris</i> (whose score
included several of Gershwin&rsquo;s songs as well as the tone poem that gave
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
this picture its title) received the Academy Award as the best picture of
the year. <i>Porgy and Bess</i> was adapted for motion pictures, in a Samuel
Goldwyn production, in 1959.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to overestimate Gershwin&rsquo;s importance in American
music. To the popular song he brought the technical skill of a consummate
musician, endowing it with a rhythmic, melodic and harmonic
language it had rarely before known. By that process he often lifted it
to the status of true art. To serious music he contributed the vitality
and the spirit&mdash;as well as the techniques and idioms&mdash;of American popular
music; serious musicians throughout the world were inspired by his
example to create a serious musical art out of the materials of American
popular music. Since his untimely death, his artistic stature has grown
in all parts of the civilized world. There will be few today to deny him
a place of honor among America&rsquo;s foremost composers.</p>
<p><i>An American in Paris</i> is a tone poem for symphony orchestra inspired
by a European vacation in 1928. It received its world premi&egrave;re in New
York on December 13, 1928, Walter Damrosch conducting the New
York Philharmonic Orchestra. In this music the composer describes the
nostalgia of an American tourist for home, and his experiences as he
strolls along the boulevards of Paris. It opens with a &ldquo;walking theme,&rdquo;
a sprightly little tune for strings and oboe; our American is beginning
his stroll. As he walks he hears the piercing warnings of taxi horns:
Gershwin&rsquo;s score calls for the use of actual Parisian taxi horns. The
American passes a caf&eacute;, and stops for a moment to listen to the sounds
of a music-hall melody, presented by the trombones. Then he resumes
his stroll, as a second walking subject is heard in the clarinet. A solo
violin (which Deems Taylor interpreted as a young lady accosting our
tourist!) provides a transition to two main melodies in both of which
the American&rsquo;s growing feeling of homesickness finds apt expression.
The first is a blues melody for muted trumpets; the second a Charleston
melody for two trumpets. The blues melody receives climactic treatment
in full orchestra. After a hasty recollection of the second walking
theme, the composition comes to a vigorous conclusion. As Mr. Taylor
goes on to explain, the tourist now decides &ldquo;to make a night of it. It
will be great to get home, but meanwhile, this is Paris!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Concerto in F, for piano and orchestra, was the immediate consequence
of Gershwin&rsquo;s phenomenal success with the <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>.
The Concerto was commissioned in 1925 by the New York Symphony
Society and its conductor, Walter Damrosch. They introduced it in
Carnegie Hall, on December 3, 1925, with the composer as soloist. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
work, like its eminent predecessor, is in a jazz style; but unlike the first
version of the <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> it boasts Gershwin&rsquo;s own orchestration.
(From this time on Gershwin would always prepare his own orchestrations
for his serious concert music.) There are three movements. The
first (<i>Allegro</i>) begins with a Charleston theme shared by the woodwind
and timpani. The main body of this movement is given over to a spicy
jazz tune first heard in the bassoon and after that in full orchestra; to a
tender melody for solo piano; and to a lilting waltz for strings with
decorative treatment by the piano. The second movement (<i>Andante
con moto</i>) is lyrical throughout, and at times subtly atmospheric and
poetic. Muted trumpet, against harmonies provided by three clarinets,
set the romantic stage for the felicitous lyrical thoughts that ensue: a
brisk, jazzy, strikingly rhythmic idea for the piano; and a broad, sensual
melody for strings. This movement ends in the same sensitive atmospheric
mood with which it began. In the finale (<i>Allegro con brio</i>) dynamic
forces are released. Main themes from the first two movements
are recalled with a particularly effective recapitulation of the second
theme of the first movement in the strings.</p>
<p>The <i>Cuban Overture</i> was written in 1932 after a brief visit to
Havana and was introduced at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York,
Albert Coates conducting, on August 16, 1932. This is a concert overture
for orchestra utilizing native percussion Cuban instruments. The
work has three sections played without interruption. The first consists
of two melodies, a Cuban theme in strings followed by a second lyrical
subject which is placed against the contrapuntal background of fragments
from the first Cuban theme. A solo clarinet cadenza leads to the
middle section which is a two-voice canon. The ensuing finale makes
considerable use of earlier thematic material and ends with an electrifying
presentation of a fully projected rumba melody in which prominent
use is made of Cuban percussion instruments (cuban stick, bongo,
gourd, and maracas).</p>
<p>The folk opera, <i>Porgy and Bess</i>, was Gershwin&rsquo;s last work in the field
of serious music&mdash;and his greatest. It took Gershwin over two years to
write his opera, a period during which he spent some time in the
opera&rsquo;s setting of Charleston, South Carolina, absorbing not only local
color but also native Negro music whose style he skilfully assimilated
into his own writing. He completed his opera in the summer of 1935;
on September 30 its world premi&egrave;re took place in Boston; and on
October 10, it began its New York run. It cannot be said that either
critics or audiences were fully aware at the time that they were hearing
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
a masterwork. Some of the Boston and New York scribes found things
to admire in the opera, but most of them were highly critical. Olin
Downes said &ldquo;it does not utilize all the resources of the operatic composer
or pierce very often to the depths of the pathetic drama.&rdquo; Lawrence
Gilman found Gershwin&rsquo;s emphasis on the popular element a disturbing
blemish while Virgil Thomson did not hesitate at the time to
refer to it as &ldquo;a fake.&rdquo; The run of 124 performances in New York (followed
by a three-month tour) represented a box-office failure.</p>
<p>Gershwin himself remained convinced he had written a work of first
importance, but regrettably he did not live to see his faith in his opera
justified beyond his wildest hopes or aspirations. Revived in New York
in 1941 it had an eight-month run, the longest of any revival in Broadway
history. More important still, many critics revised earlier estimates.
Virgil Thomson now spoke of it as &ldquo;a beautiful piece of music and a
deeply moving play for the lyric theater.&rdquo; Olin Downes said that
Gershwin had here &ldquo;taken a substantial step, and advanced the cause of
native opera.&rdquo; The New York Music Critics Circle singled it out as the
most important musical revival of that season.</p>
<p>But still greater triumphs awaited the opera. In 1952, a Negro cast
toured Europe under the auspices of the State Department. Before that
tour was over, several years later, the opera had been heard throughout
Europe, the Near East, in countries behind the Iron Curtain, the Soviet
Union and Latin America. Everywhere it enjoyed acclaim realized by
few contemporary operas anywhere. There were not many dissenting
voices in the universal judgment that <i>Porgy and Bess</i> was one of the most
significant operas of the twentieth century, and certainly one of the most
popular. And its popularity was further enhanced by the stunning production
given it by Samuel Goldwyn in motion pictures in 1959.</p>
<p>The text of the opera was based on the play <i>Porgy</i>, by Dorothy and
Du Bose Heyward, produced by the Theater Guild in New York in
1927, which in turn had been adapted from Du Bose Heyward&rsquo;s novel
of the same name. The opera text and lyrics were written by Du Bose
and Dorothy Heyward with several additional lyrics by Ira Gershwin.
The tragic love affair of the cripple, Porgy, and Bess, a lady of easy
virtue, is set in the Negro tenement, Catfish Row, in Charleston, South
Carolina. Porgy has found true happiness with Bess for the first time
in his life. When Crown, Bess&rsquo; old sweetheart returns to claim her,
Porgy kills him but manages to elude the law after having been detained
a while. Upon returning to Catfish Row he discovers that his Bess had
succumbed to the lure of dope, and the gay life in New York offered her
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
by Sportin&rsquo; Life. Heartbroken, Porgy jumps in his goat cart to follow
Bess to New York and try to bring her back.</p>
<p>The main melodic sections of the opera have provided the material
for several delightful suites. The most famous is <i>A Symphonic Picture</i>
by Robert Russell Bennett, commissioned by Fritz Reiner, the conductor
of the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1942. Bennett created out of the
score an integrated tone poem faithful to Gershwin&rsquo;s own harmonic and
orchestral intentions. The tone poem (or suite) is made up of the following
sequences in the order of their appearance: Scene of Catfish Row
with the peddler&rsquo;s calls; Opening Act II; &ldquo;Summertime&rdquo; and Opening
of Act I; &ldquo;I Got Plenty of Nuttin&rsquo;&rdquo;; Storm Music; &ldquo;Bess, You Is My
Woman Now&rdquo;; &ldquo;It Ain&rsquo;t Necessarily So&rdquo; and the finale, &ldquo;Oh Lawd
I&rsquo;m On My Way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Gershwin himself prepared an orchestral suite from his opera
score in 1936, and conducted it in performances with several major
American orchestras in 1936-1937. This manuscript, long forgotten,
was found in the library of Ira Gershwin, and was revived in 1959 by
Maurice Abravanel and the Utah Symphony. Now named <i>Catfish Row</i>,
to distinguish it from other suites prepared by other musicians, it had
five sections: &ldquo;Catfish Row,&rdquo; &ldquo;Porgy Sings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fugue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hurricane,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Good Morning, Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beryl Rubinstein transcribed five of the principal melodies from the
opera for piano, and Jascha Heifetz for violin and piano.</p>
<p>The three piano <i>Preludes</i> are famous not only in their original version
but also in transcriptions for symphony orchestra. The first prelude,
in B-flat major, is rhythmically exciting, highlighting the basic
elements of the tango and the Charleston. The second, in C-sharp
minor, is the most famous of the set. This is an eloquent three-part
blues melody. The concluding prelude, in E-flat major, once again like
the first one has greater rhythmic than melodic interest, a lively expression
of uninhibited good feelings. Besides transcriptions for orchestra
by Roy Bargy, Gregory Stone and several others, these preludes have
been adapted for violin and piano by Heifetz, for trumpet and piano by
Gregory Stone, and for saxophone and piano by Sigurd Rascher.</p>
<p>The <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> was Gershwin&rsquo;s first work for symphony orchestra
and it is the composition with which he first won fame, fortune,
and artistic significance. It was commissioned by Paul Whiteman for
an all-American music concert planned by that bandleader for Aeolian
Hall, New York, on February 12, 1924. With the composer at the piano,
the <i>Rhapsody</i> appeared as the tenth and penultimate number of a long
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
program, but it was the work that gave Whiteman&rsquo;s concert its main
interest and significance. The critics the following day were divided in
their opinion. On the one hand, Henry T. Finck considered it superior
to the music of Schoenberg and Milhaud; equally high words of praise
came from Gilbert W. Gabriel, William J. Henderson, Olin Downes,
Deems Taylor, and Carl van Vechten. In the opposite camp stood Pitts
Sanborn and Lawrence Gilman who described the work as &ldquo;meaningless
repetition&rdquo; and &ldquo;trite, feeble, and conventional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the opposing opinions notwithstanding, the <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>
immediately became one of the most famous pieces of serious music by
an American. It was transcribed for every possible instrument or groups
of instruments; it was adapted several times for ballet; it was used in a
motion picture. Royalties from the sale of sheet music and records
brought in a fortune. Through the years it has never lost its popularity;
it is still one of the most frequently performed American symphonic
works.</p>
<p>Its prime significance rests in the fact that it decisively proved that it
was possible to produce good music within ambitious structures utilizing
idioms and techniques of American jazz. The <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> was
by no means the first composition to do so; it was preceded by works
by Erik Satie, Stravinsky, and Milhaud among others. But due to its
enormous popular appeal it was the most influential composition of all
in convincing the world&rsquo;s foremost composers that jazz could be used
with serious intent. Undoubtedly it was largely as a result of the triumph
of the <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> that world-famous composers like William
Walton, Constant Lambert, Maurice Ravel, Kurt Weill and Paul
Hindemith among many others produced serious jazz music.</p>
<p>Much has been said about its diffuseness of structure, and the inept
way its material is developed. But for all its faults, the <i>Rhapsody in
Blue</i> remains a vital, dynamic and at times an inspired piece of music.
It is filled with wonderful lyricism; its rhythmic cogency is irresistible;
its identity is completely American.</p>
<p>The work opened with an ascending seventeen-note slide by the
clarinet which culminates in the saucy, first theme. A transition in the
wind instrument leads to another brisk, jaunty idea for piano. After
some development, and several ascending chords in the piano we get to
the heart of the rhapsody and to one of the most famous melodies in all
contemporary symphonic music: a spacious, rhapsodic song for the
strings. The full orchestra repeats it. Two earlier themes are now briefly
recalled, the first theme by the full orchestra, the second by the piano.
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
A brief, dramatic coda brings the rhapsody to an exciting conclusion.</p>
<p>For the Paul Whiteman concert of 1924, Ferde Grof&eacute; provided the
orchestration from a two-piano version handed him by the composer.
Gershwin later prepared his own orchestration, and it is this version
that is now given by all the major symphonic organizations.</p>
<p>The <i>Second Rhapsody</i> for orchestra succeeded the more popular
<i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> by eight years; it was first performed by the Boston
Symphony under Koussevitzky on January 29, 1932. Gershwin originally
called this work <i>Rhapsody in Rivets</i> because the opening measures
present a strongly rhythmic subject in solo piano suggesting riveting.
This &ldquo;rivet theme&rdquo; is then taken over by the full orchestra, after
which we hear a rumba melody. These ideas are then developed. A
piano cadenza brings on a spacious melody, first in strings, and then in
brass. All this material is amplified before the rhapsody is swept to an
exciting end.</p>
<p>This rhapsody was the outgrowth of a six-minute sequence written
by the composer for the motion picture, <i>Delicious</i>. The sequence was
intended to describe the sights and sounds of a city. In the picture only
one of the six minutes of this music was retained, but Gershwin liked
the rest of it well enough to expand it into a major symphonic work.</p>
<p>The <i>Variations on I Got Rhythm</i>, for piano and orchestra, was
written for a tour of one-night stands made by Gershwin throughout
the United States in all-Gershwin programs. Its first performance took
place in Boston on January 14, 1934. The main subject is a famous
Gershwin song, &ldquo;I Got Rhythm&rdquo; which Ethel Merman made famous in
the musical comedy <i>Girl Crazy</i>. The symphonic work begins with a
four-note ascending phrase from the first measure of the song&rsquo;s chorus,
presented by solo clarinet. The theme is then taken over by solo piano
and after that by full orchestra, after which the entire chorus is presented
by the piano. In the ensuing variations the composer changes
not only the basic structure of the song, melodically and rhythmically,
but also its mood and feeling, traversing the gamut of emotion from
melancholy to spirited gaiety.</p>
<p>Still another remarkably effective symphonic adaptation of &ldquo;I Got
Rhythm&rdquo; was made by Morton Gould, and introduced by him with his
orchestra over the CBS radio network in 1944.</p>
<p>Gershwin wrote two marches, both with satirical overtones, which
are often given at &ldquo;pop concerts.&rdquo; Each was meant for a musical comedy.
&ldquo;Strike Up the Band&rdquo; comes from the musical comedy of the same
name, produced on January 14, 1930 starring Clark and McCullough.
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
This was a stinging satire on war and international diplomacy, with
America embroiled in a conflict with Switzerland over the issue of
chocolates. The march, &ldquo;Strike Up the Band,&rdquo; helps deflate some of the
pomp and ceremony of all martial music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wintergreen for President&rdquo; comes from <i>Of Thee I Sing</i>, the epoch-making
satire on politics in Washington, D.C., first produced on December
26, 1931. &ldquo;Wintergreen for President&rdquo; is the music accompanying
a political torchlight parade whose illuminated signs read &ldquo;Even
Your Dog Loves Wintergreen&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Vote for Wintergreen Is a Vote
for Wintergreen&rdquo; and so on. The march music carries over the satirical
implications of this procession by quoting such tunes as &ldquo;Hail, Hail the
Gang&rsquo;s All Here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tammany,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Stars and Stripes Forever.&rdquo; This music even carries a hasty
recollection of Irish and Jewish music to suggest that Wintergreen is a
friend of both these people.</p>
<p>Gershwin&rsquo;s greatest songs are often performed in orchestral transcriptions
at all-Gershwin concerts and other &ldquo;pop performances,&rdquo; sometimes
singly, and sometimes in various potpourris. Besides songs already
mentioned in the first part of this section, Gershwin&rsquo;s greatest
ones include the following: &ldquo;Bidin&rsquo; My Time&rdquo; from <i>Girl Crazy</i>; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
Got a Crush On You&rdquo; from <i>Strike Up the Band</i>; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Call the Whole
Thing Off&rdquo; from <i>Shall We Dance</i>; &ldquo;Liza&rdquo; from <i>Show Girl</i>; &ldquo;The Man
I Love,&rdquo; originally meant for <i>Lady Be Good</i> but never used there;
&ldquo;Mine&rdquo; from <i>Let &rsquo;Em Eat Cake</i>; the title song from <i>Of Thee I Sing</i>;
&ldquo;Soon&rdquo; from <i>Strike Up the Band</i>; &ldquo;That Certain Feeling&rdquo; from <i>Tip
Toes</i>; and &ldquo;They Can&rsquo;t Take That Away From Me&rdquo; from <i>Shall We
Dance</i>. Among those who have written orchestral medleys of Gershwin&rsquo;s
songs are Nathan van Cleve, Fred von Epps, Claude Thornhill, David
Broekman, Irving Brodsky, George B. Leeman, and Nathaniel Finston.</p>

<h2 id="c61"><span class="small">Henry F. <b id="g_Gilbert">Gilbert</b></span></h2>
<p>Henry Franklin Belknap Gilbert was born
in Somerville, Massachusetts, on September 26, 1868. He attended the
New England Conservatory, and studied composition privately with
Edward MacDowell, before playing the violin in various theaters. For
many years music was a secondary pursuit as he earned his living in
a printing establishment, a real-estate agent, factory foreman, and
finally an employee in a music-publishing firm. A hearing in Paris of
Gustave Charpentier&rsquo;s opera, <i>Louise</i>, proved such an overpowering
experience that it inspired him to devote himself henceforth to music
alone. In 1902 he helped found in America the Wa-Wan Press which
promoted nationalism in American music and published Gilbert&rsquo;s first
works. In these a strong emphasis was placed by the composer upon
American folk music and American folk idioms. In 1903 he wrote
<i>Humoresque on Negro Minstrel Tunes</i>. After that came his famous
<i>Comedy Overture on Negro Themes</i> (1905), the symphonic ballet <i>The
Dance in Place Congo</i> (1906), the <i>Negro Rhapsody</i> (1913), and <i>Indian
Sketches</i> (1921). Here native elements were skilfully fused into a style
that was Romantic to produce music that remains appealing for its
freshness and vitality. Towards the end of his life, Gilbert was an invalid.
Nevertheless, in 1927, he traveled to Germany in a wheel-chair to
attend a performance of his <i>Dance in Place Congo</i> at the Festival of
the International Society for Contemporary Music in Frankfurt. He
died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 19, 1928.</p>
<p>The <i>Comedy Overture on Negro Themes</i> (1905) is one of Gilbert&rsquo;s
most frequently performed compositions. It is made up of five sections
played without interruption. The composer goes on to explain: &ldquo;The
first movement is light and humorous, the theme being made from two
four-measure phrases taken from Charles L. Edwards&rsquo; book <i>Bahama
Songs and Stories</i>.... This is followed by a broader, and somewhat
slower, phrase. I have here used the only complete Negro tune which
occurs in the piece ... formerly used as a working song by roustabouts
and stevedores on the Mississippi River steamboats in the old
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
days.... Next comes a fugue. The theme of this fugue consists of the
first four measures of the Negro Spiritual &lsquo;Old Ship of Zion.&rsquo;... It is
given out by the brass instruments and interspersed with phrases from
the roustabouts&rsquo; song.... After this a short phrase of sixteen measures
serves to reintroduce the comic element. There is a repetition of
the first theme and considerable recapitulation, which leads finally to
the development of a new ending or coda, and the piece ends in an orgy
of jollity and ragtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Dance in Place Congo</i> (1906) is both a ballet and a tone poem for
orchestra. Its first version was a pantomime ballet, but soon thereafter
the composer adapted his score into a composition for orchestra. The
tone poem&mdash;describing the barbaric revels on a late Sunday afternoon
of slaves in Place Congo, a section on the outskirts of New Orleans&mdash;opens
in a dark mood which achieves a climax with an outcry in the
orchestra. At this point a bamboula melody is heard in full orchestra. It
is permitted to gain in intensity until it acquires barbaric ferocity.
When the passions are spent, a beautiful romantic section unfolds, occasionally
interrupted by a recall of the bamboula theme. Various Negro
songs and dances are then presented over an insistent rhythm. The
somber mood of the opening is brought back to conclude the composition.</p>
<p><i>The Indian Sketches</i> for orchestra (1921) presents several facets of
American-Indian life. &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; explains the composer, &ldquo;for the most
part not musical pictures of definite incidents so much as they are
musical mood pictures.&rdquo; There are six sections. The first, a prelude, is
music of savage power. This is followed by the subjective music of the
&ldquo;Invocation,&rdquo; a prayer or supplication of the Great Spirit. &ldquo;Song of
the World&rdquo; briefly develops a cry of the Kutenai Indians, and &ldquo;Camp
Dance&rdquo; is a scherzo portraying the lighter side of Indian life. &ldquo;Nocturne&rdquo;
is a romantic description of the dark forests alive with the distant
sounds of birds and animals. The suite concludes with the &ldquo;Snake
Dance,&rdquo; suggested by a prayer dance for rain of the Hopi Indians in
Arizona.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c62"><span class="small">Don <b id="g_Gillis">Gillis</b></span></h2>
<p>Don Gillis was born in Cameron, Missouri, on June 17, 1912.
He was graduated from Christian University at Fort Worth, Texas in
1936, after having engaged in various musical activities including the
direction of a band and a symphony orchestra, and the writing of two
musical comedies produced at the University. Following the completion
of his education he became a member of the faculty of Christian
University and Southwest Baptist Seminary; served as a trombonist
and arranger for a Fort Worth radio station; and played the trombone
in the Fort Worth Symphony. In 1944 he became a producer for the
National Broadcasting Company in New York, taking charge of many
important programs including those of the NBC Symphony.</p>
<p>As a composer of symphonies and other orchestral compositions Gillis
reveals a refreshing sense of humor as well as a delightful bent for
whimsy, qualities which make some of his works ideal for programs of
light music. He has often drawn inspiration and materials from American
folk music and jazz, consistently producing music that combines
sound musical values with sound entertainment. &ldquo;My feeling,&rdquo; he has
said, &ldquo;is that music is for the people and the composer&rsquo;s final aim should
be to reach them. And since the people whistle and sing, I should like
them to whistle and sing my music.&rdquo; Thus Gillis aims for simplicity,
sincere emotions, and sheer fun. &ldquo;I have tried to write so that there will
be a feeling of enjoyment in the fun of the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Portrait of a Frontier Town</i>, a suite for orchestra (1940), is a tuneful
composition consisting of five short movements. The title of each of
these provides the clue to the programmatic content of the music. The
first, &ldquo;Chamber of Commerce,&rdquo; portrays the activities of such an organization
in a typical American town. &ldquo;Where the West Begins&rdquo; tells of
the opening of the West through two significant musical subjects, the
first for strings, and the second for oboe, flute, and clarinet. &ldquo;Ranch
House Party&rdquo; is described in the score as &ldquo;brightly&mdash;in a gay manner.&rdquo;
A jovial melody first given by the full orchestra gives prominent attention
to percussion instruments. This is followed by a mood picture,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
&ldquo;Prairie Sunset&rdquo; in which the English horn, answered by the clarinet,
presents the main melody. The suite concludes with &ldquo;Main Street
Saturday Night,&rdquo; in which gaiety and abandon alternate with suggestions
of nostalgia.</p>
<p><i>Symphony No. 5&frac12;</i> (1947), is one of the composer&rsquo;s wittiest works
which he himself subtitled as &ldquo;a symphony for fun.&rdquo; It consists almost
entirely of jazz melodies, some treated in burlesque fashion; the work
also quotes some famous melodies in a facetious manner. The four
movements have whimsical titles: &ldquo;Perpetual Emotion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spiritual?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Scherzophrenia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c63"><span class="small">Alberto <b id="g_Ginastera">Ginastera</b></span></h2>
<p>Alberto Ginastera was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
on April 11, 1916. He was graduated with honors from the National
Conservatory in his native city where, in 1953, he became professor.
In 1946 he visited the United States remaining a year on a Guggenheim
Fellowship. Ginastera&rsquo;s music combines musical elements
native to Argentina with modern techniques and idioms, and includes
ballets, chamber music, a <i>Pastoral Symphony</i> and other works for
orchestra, and pieces for the piano.</p>
<p>The <i>Dances</i> from the ballet, <i>Estancia</i> (1941) is among his most popular
works. The ballet, choreography by George Balanchine, was first
introduced by the Ballet Caravan. It describes life on an &ldquo;estancia,&rdquo; an
Argentine ranch, tracing the activities of its principal character through
a single day from dawn of one day to dawn of the next. The orchestral
dances are rich in native melodies and rhythms, presenting the various
dance sequences in &ldquo;stylized version.&rdquo; Two dances are especially popular:
&ldquo;Dance of the Wheat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Malambo.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c64"><span class="small">Alexander <b id="g_Glazunov">Glazunov</b></span></h2>
<p>Alexander Glazunov was born in St. Petersburg,
Russia, on August 10, 1865. As a boy he studied music privately while
attending a technical high school. At fifteen he became a pupil of
Rimsky-Korsakov in harmony, counterpoint and orchestration. Such
was his progress that only one year later he completed a gifted symphony
which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1882 and acclaimed by
several eminent Russian musicians. Between that year and 1900,
Glazunov produced most of the works which won him renown not only
in Russia but throughout the rest of the music world: symphonies,
string quartets, numerous shorter orchestral works, and compositions
in a lighter style. Here he was the traditionalist who placed reliance on
palatable melodies, sound structures, and heartfelt emotion. For these
reasons much of what he has written falls gracefully into the light-classic
category. After 1914 he wrote little, nothing to add to his stature.
Meanwhile he achieved renown first as professor then as director of the
St. Petersburg Conservatory. He also made successful appearances as
conductor following his debut at the Paris Exposition in 1899; his first
appearance in the United States took place in Detroit on November 21,
1929. In 1928, Glazunov left his native land for good, and from then
until his death on March 21, 1936 his home was in Paris.</p>
<p>The <i>Carnival Overture</i>, or <i>Carnaval</i>, op. 45 (1894) is a brilliant picture
of a festival. It opens with a lively dance melody in violins and
woodwind. This is followed by a more stately melody in woodwind and
violins against a counter-melody in cellos and bassoons. A brief transition
leads to the main body of the overture built out of two basic ideas.
The first is a gay dance tune in flutes and clarinets; the second provides
a measure of contrast through a more reflective subject for oboes, clarinets,
horns, and cellos.</p>
<p><i>From the Middle Ages</i>&mdash;a suite for orchestra, op. 79 (1902)&mdash;evokes
the settings and backgrounds of the middle ages in four sections. The
first is a &ldquo;Prelude,&rdquo; portraying a castle by the sea, the home of two
lovers. Death plays the violin in the second movement, a &ldquo;Scherzo&rdquo;;
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
he urges the people to dance to his abandoned fiddling. In the third
part, &ldquo;Serenade,&rdquo; a troubadour sings his tune. The suite ends with
&ldquo;The Crusaders,&rdquo; in which soldiers are marching off to war, while
priests chant a solemn blessing.</p>
<p>The original title of <i>Ouverture solennelle</i>, op. 73 (1901) was <i>Festival
Overture</i>; the music throughout has a festive character. After preliminary
chords, woodwind and horns present a subject soon taken over and
amplified by the strings. The main part of the overture begins with
an expressive and soulful melody for the violins. The second theme
is first given by the clarinets against a vigorous accompaniment. After
the first theme receives elaboration, the overture concludes with a
forceful coda.</p>
<p>The orchestral suite <i>Raymonda</i>, op. 57a, comes from the score to a ballet
with choreography by Marius Petipa; it was introduced in St. Petersburg
on January 17, 1898. The composer&rsquo;s first work for the stage, this
ballet has for its central character the lovely Raymonda, betrothed to a
knight. After the knight has gone off to join the Crusade and fight the
Saracens, Raymonda is wooed by a Saracen. When she rejects him he
makes an attempt to abduct her. Just then the knight returns, and slays
the culprit. The lovers thus reunited, are now able to celebrate their
nuptials.</p>
<p>The orchestral suite is a staple in the light-classical repertory. It consists
of the following sections: I. &ldquo;Introduction.&rdquo; Raymonda&rsquo;s sorrow at
the absence of her lover. A scene in Raymonda&rsquo;s castle where pages
indulge in athletics. II. &ldquo;<i>La Traditrice.</i>&rdquo; The dance of pages and
maidens. III. &ldquo;<i>Moderato.</i>&rdquo; Fanfares announce the arrival of a stranger.
Joy and general animation. As Raymonda enters, girls throw flowers in
her path. IV. &ldquo;<i>Andante.</i>&rdquo; Raymonda is playing the lute outside the
castle in the moonlight. Raymonda dances. VI. &ldquo;Entr&rsquo;acte; <i>Valse fantastique</i>.&rdquo;
Raymonda dreams she is in fairyland with her beloved.
VII. &ldquo;<i>Grand Pas d&rsquo;action.</i>&rdquo; At a feast given by Raymonda at her castle
the Saracen appears, woos her, and is spurned. VIII. &ldquo;Variation.&rdquo; Raymonda
defies the Saracen, who now tries to dazzle her with his wealth.
IX. &ldquo;Dance of the Arab Boys.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dance of the Saracens.&rdquo; X. &ldquo;Entr&rsquo;acte.&rdquo;
The triumph of love and the festivities attending the nuptials.</p>
<p><i>Sc&egrave;nes de ballet</i>, suite for orchestra, op. 52 (1894) is made up of eight
parts. The first, &ldquo;<i>Pr&eacute;amble</i>,&rdquo; has an extended introduction to a main
section in which the main subject is given by the violins. &ldquo;Marionettes,&rdquo;
offers a lively theme for piccolo and glockenspiel with which this section
opens and closes; midway comes a trio with main theme in first
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
violins. The third part is a &ldquo;Mazurka&rdquo; for full orchestra. The fourth is
a &ldquo;Scherzo,&rdquo; its principal idea in muted strings and woodwind. An
expressive melody for cellos and violins is the heart of the fifth section,
&ldquo;<i>Pas d&rsquo;action</i>,&rdquo; while the sixth, &ldquo;<i>Dame orientale</i>&rdquo; is a sensuous, exotic
dance melody set against the insistent beats of a tambourine. The ensuing
&ldquo;<i>Valse</i>&rdquo; begins with an introduction following which the main
waltz melody is presented by the violins. The suite concludes with a
dashing &ldquo;Polonaise&rdquo; for full orchestra.</p>
<p>The orchestral suite, <i>The Seasons</i>, op. 67&mdash;like that of <i>Raymonda</i>&mdash;comes
from a ballet score. The ballet&mdash;choreography by Marius Petipa&mdash;was
first performed in St. Petersburg in 1900. The scenario interprets
the four seasons of the year in four scenes and an apotheosis. First comes
Winter and her two gnomes; they burn a bundle of faggots, whose
heat causes Winter to disappear. Spring now arrives with Zephyr, Birds
and Flowers. All of them join in a joyous dance. When Summer comes
he is in the company of the Spirit of the Corn. Various flowers perform
a dance, then fall exhausted on the ground. Satyrs and fauns, playing
on pipes, try to recapture the Spirit of the Corn who is protected by the
flowers. In the Autumn scene, Bacchantes perform a dance in the company
of the Seasons. The Apotheosis presents an idyllic scene with stars
shining brightly in the sky.</p>
<p>The orchestral suite adapted from the ballet score by the composer
for concert purposes is one of his best known compositions. It consists
of the following sections: I. &ldquo;Winter: Introduction; The Frost; The
Ice; The Hail; The Snow.&rdquo; II. &ldquo;Spring.&rdquo; III. &ldquo;Summer: Waltz of the
Cornflowers and Poppies; Barcarolle; Variation; Coda.&rdquo; IV. &ldquo;Autumn:
Bacchanale&mdash;Petit Adagio. Finale&mdash;The Bacchantes and Apotheosis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Valse de concert</i> Nos. 1 and 2, D major and F major respectively,
opp. 47 and 51, are among the composer&rsquo;s most delightful shorter
pieces. The first waltz, written in 1893, begins with a brief introduction
after which the principal waltz melody is heard first in violas and
clarinets, and subsequently in violins. A second theme is then offered
by the clarinets against plucked strings, after which the first waltz reappears.
The second waltz came one year after the first. This also has
a short introduction in which the main waltz melody is suggested. This
melody is finally given by the strings. While other thematic material
occasionally intrudes, the main waltz subject dominates the entire
composition.</p>

<h2 id="c65"><span class="small">Reinhold <b id="g_Gliere">Gli&egrave;re</b></span></h2>
<p>Reinhold Gli&egrave;re was born in Kiev, Russia, on January
11, 1875. He was graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1900.
After two years in Berlin, he returned to his native land to become professor
of composition at the Kiev Conservatory; from 1914 to 1920 he
was its director. After 1920 he was a member of the faculty of the Moscow
Conservatory. Gli&egrave;re&rsquo;s most famous works are his third symphony
(named <i>Ilia Mourometz</i>) introduced in Moscow in 1912, and the ballet,
<i>The Red Poppy</i>. But he wrote many other works&mdash;orchestral, chamber,
and vocal, as well as ballets. On two occasions he received the Stalin
Prize: in 1948 for his fourth string quartet, and two years later for his
ballet, <i>The Bronze Horseman</i>. He died in Moscow on June 23, 1956.</p>
<p>Two excerpts from the Soviet ballet, <i>The Red Poppy</i>, are perhaps
the composer&rsquo;s best known compositions. The ballet was first presented
in Moscow on June 14, 1927 with extraordinary success. Its setting is a
port in China where coolies are exploited. When a Soviet ship comes
to port, its captain falls in love with a Chinese girl, Tai-Hao. She is
ultimately killed by the port commander while she is trying to escape
from China on the Soviet ship. Her last words urge the Chinese to fight
for their liberty, and she points to a red poppy as a symbol of their
freedom.</p>
<p>The most celebrated single excerpt from this ballet is the <i>Russian
Sailors Dance</i>, for orchestra, with which the third act comes to a whirlwind
conclusion. The main melody is a simple Russian tune that
appears first in lower strings. It is then subjected to a series of variations,
and is permitted to gain momentum through acceleration of
tempo and expanding sonorities until an orgiastic climax is reached.
Less popular, but still often performed, is the &ldquo;Dance of the Chinese
Girls&rdquo; from the same ballet. A repeated descending interval leads to an
Oriental dance in the pentatonic scale; in this dance percussion instruments
and the xylophone are used prominently and with telling effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c66"><span class="small">Michael <b id="g_Glinka">Glinka</b></span></h2>
<p>Michael Glinka was born to prosperous landowners in
Novosspaskoye, in Smolensk, Russia, on June 1, 1804. His academic
education took place at a private school in St. Petersburg, while he
studied music with Carl Meyer, Carl Boehm and John Field. From
1824 to 1827 he worked in the office of the Ministry of Communications
in St. Petersburg. Further music study then took place in Italy and Germany.
After returning to his native land in 1834, he was fired with the
ambition of writing a national Russian opera. That opera was <i>A Life
for the Tsar</i>, produced in 1836, an epoch-making work since it is the
foundation upon which all later Russian national music rests. Glinka&rsquo;s
second national opera, <i>Ruslan and Ludmila</i>, produced in 1842, successfully
carried on the composer&rsquo;s national ideals further. In the last years
of his life Glinka traveled a great deal, spending considerable time in
Paris, Warsaw, and Spain. He died suddenly in Berlin, Germany, on
February 15, 1857.</p>
<p>It is impossible to overestimate Glinka&rsquo;s significance in Russian music.
His national operas were the source from which the later nationalists,
the &ldquo;Russian Five&rdquo; derived their direction and inspiration.</p>
<p>In <i>Jota aragonesa</i>, a &ldquo;caprice brilliant&rdquo; for orchestra (1845) Glinka
is stimulated by Spanish rather than Russian folk music. This is the
first Russian composition to make serious use of Spanish folk idioms.
It was written during the composer&rsquo;s visit to Spain in 1845 where he
was fascinated by Spanish folk songs and dances. Within a fantasy form,
Glinka poured melodies and dance rhythms closely modeled after the
Spanish in which the background, culture, and geography of that colorful
country have been fixed.</p>
<p><i>Kamarinskaya</i> (1848), also for orchestra, is a fantasy in the field in
which Glinka was both an acknowledged master and a significant
pioneer&mdash;Russian folk music. This composition is based on two Russian
folk songs heard by the composer in Warsaw: &ldquo;Over the Hills, the High
Hills&rdquo; (which appears in strings following a brief introduction), and a
dance tune, &ldquo;Kamarinskaya&rdquo; (first heard in violins).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The most popular excerpts from Glinka&rsquo;s national opera, <i>A Life for
the Tsar</i>, are the overture, and the Mazurka and Waltz, for orchestra.
The opera&mdash;libretto by Baron von Rosen&mdash;was first performed in St.
Petersburg on December 9, 1836. The action takes place in Poland and
Russia in 1612. During the struggle between Russia and Poland,
Romanov becomes the new Czar of Russia, and Ivan Susanin, a peasant,
is the hero who saves Russia and the Czar. The love interest involves
Ivan&rsquo;s daughter, Antonida, and Bogdan Sabinin.</p>
<p>The overture opens with a stately introduction dominated by a
melody for the oboe. A spirited melody brings on the main section.
After this melody is developed, a second theme is offered by the clarinets.
Both ideas are discoursed upon briefly, and they are given further
amplification in the coda.</p>
<p>The Mazurka and Waltz appear at the close of the second act, climaxing
a festive celebration held in the throne room of Sigismund III of
Poland in his ancient castle. The Waltz comes first. Two principal
waltz melodies are given by the woodwind and repeated by strings; a
third waltz tune is then heard in brass, and soon taken over by the
strings. The Waltz is immediately followed by the Mazurka. After a
dignified introduction, a vigorous Mazurka melody unfolds. This leads
to a second dance tune, first heard in the woodwind and cellos; but the
first Mazurka melody soon reappears in the full orchestra. A third lively
dance melody is then presented by the strings.</p>
<p><i>Ruslan and Ludmila</i> also contributed a lively overture to the orchestral
repertory. This opera, with libretto by the composer and several
others based on a Pushkin poem, was first heard in St. Petersburg on
December 9, 1842. Ruslan is a knight who is a rival of Ratmir for the
love of Ludmila. Ludmila is abducted by the dwarf Tchernomor, and
after Ruslan has saved her, Ludmila&rsquo;s father blesses his future son-in-law.</p>
<p>Vigorous chords lead to a dashing melody in violins, violas and woodwinds.
A more lyrical second theme, almost folk-song in character, is
then heard in violas, cellos and bassoons. Both themes are given a vigorous
development in which the sprightly character of the overture is
never allowed to lose its brisk pace or vitality.</p>

<h2 id="c67"><span class="small">Christoph Willibald <b id="g_Gluck">Gluck</b></span></h2>
<p>Christoph Willibald Gluck was born in Erasbach,
Upper Palatinate, on July 2, 1714, the son of a forester on the
estate of Prince Lobkowitz. Gluck received his early music instruction
in his native country from local teachers. He then earned his living
playing the violin and cello in rural orchestras. In 1736 he came to
Vienna where soon thereafter he began to serve as chamber musician
for Prince Lobkowitz. After a period of study and travel in Italy he
returned to Vienna, now to become one of its most influential musicians.
In Vienna he had produced several of his early operas, all of them
in the traditional Italian style of that period. But he soon drew away
from the stilted conventions of the Italian opera to achieve a fusion of
music and drama new to opera, as well as dramatic truth, simplicity,
and directness of emotional appeal. His works in this new style, with
which a new epoch in opera was launched, included <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i>
in 1762, <i>Alceste</i> in 1767, and <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide</i> in 1774, the last
written for the Paris stage. After living in Paris from 1773 to 1779,
Gluck returned to Vienna to remain there the rest of his life. During
his last years he was an invalid. He died in Vienna on November 15,
1787.</p>
<p>Gluck was a giant in the early history of opera. With Rameau, he
was a pioneer in establishing music drama as opposed to formal Italian
opera. <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i>, produced in Vienna on October 5, 1762&mdash;with
which Gluck first set forth his new ideas and theories about opera&mdash;is
the earliest opera to have survived in the permanent repertory.</p>
<p>A delightful <i>Ballet Suite</i>, adapted by Felix Mottl from various orchestral
dances from several of Gluck&rsquo;s greatest operas, is an orchestral work
by which the composer is most often represented on semi-classical as
well as symphonic programs. This suite includes the following: &ldquo;Dance
of the Blessed Spirits&rdquo; from <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i>; &ldquo;<i>Air gai</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Lento</i>&rdquo;
from <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide</i>; and two old baroque dances, the &ldquo;Musette&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Sicilienne&rdquo; from <i>Armide</i>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Dance of the Blessed Spirits&rdquo; is one of the loveliest of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
Gluck&rsquo;s melodies, and one of the most famous from 18th century opera.
This is a beatific song mainly for flute solo and strings, describing
Elysium, to which Orfeo has come in search of his wife, Eurydice. Fritz
Kreisler&rsquo;s transcription for violin and piano is entitled <i>M&eacute;lodie</i>. Sgambati
arranged it for piano solo, and Gruenfeld for cello and piano.</p>
<h2 id="c68"><span class="small">Benjamin <b id="g_Godard">Godard</b></span></h2>
<p>Benjamin Louis Godard was born in Paris on August
18, 1849. After attending the Paris Conservatory, he received in
1878 a municipal prize for an orchestral work, besides having his first
opera produced. He wrote several operas after that, winning fame with
<i>Jocelyn</i> in 1888. He also wrote a considerable amount of chamber and
orchestral music, in which his fine, sensitive lyricism is evident. He
died in Cannes, France, on January 10, 1895.</p>
<p>Among his more familiar works is the <i>Adagio path&eacute;tique</i>. This
started out as a piece for violin and piano, the third of a set of compositions
in op. 128. It was orchestrated by Ross Jungnickel in 1910, and is
most popular in this version. This is music notable for its expressive
emotion; its lyricism at times has a religious stateliness.</p>
<p>The most famous single piece of music by Godard, however, is the
&ldquo;Berceuse&rdquo; from his opera, <i>Jocelyn</i>. With libretto by Paul Armand
and Silvestre and Victor Capoul&mdash;based on a poem by Lamartine&mdash;<i>Jocelyn</i>
was introduced in Brussels on February 25, 1888. The setting is
France during the French Revolution, and concerns the love of Jocelyn,
a young priest, for the daughter of a nobleman. After many inner
struggles, Jocelyn decides to remain true to his calling and give up his
beloved. They meet for the last time at her deathbed to which Jocelyn
has been summoned to administer absolution. The &ldquo;Berceuse&rdquo; is a
tender aria by Jocelyn (&ldquo;<i>Cach&eacute;s dans cet asile</i>&rdquo;) in which he calls upon
angels to protect his loved one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c69"><span class="small">Leopold <b id="g_Godowsky">Godowsky</b></span></h2>
<p>Leopold Godowsky was born in Soshly, near Vilna,
Poland, on February 13, 1870. A prodigy pianist, he attended the Berlin
High School for Music, after which he made his American debut in
Boston in 1884. Additional study took place in Paris with Saint-Sa&euml;ns.
Godowsky then launched his career as a mature concert pianist with
performances throughout the world of music. He achieved international
renown not only as a virtuoso but also as a teacher of the piano,
at the Chicago Conservatory and the Vienna Academy. His concert
career ended in 1930 when he was stricken by a slight paralysis of the
hand. As a composer, Godowsky was most famous for his suites for the
piano, the most famous being <i>Triakontameron</i>, <i>Java</i>, and <i>Renaissance</i>.
He also produced a library of remarkable transcriptions for the piano.
He died in New York City on November 21, 1938.</p>
<p>Though Godowsky was a sophisticated composer of highly complex
piano works, he did succeed in producing at least one number that became
an international &ldquo;hit.&rdquo; It was the <i>Alt Wien</i> (<i>Old Vienna</i>), a sentimental,
nostalgic piece of music on whose title page appears the following
quotation: &ldquo;Whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile through
tears.&rdquo; <i>Alt Wien</i> is the eleventh number in <i>Triakontameron</i> (1920),
a suite in six volumes described by the composer as &ldquo;thirty moods and
scenes in triple measure.&rdquo; The immense popularity of <i>Alt Wien</i> is
proved by its many and varied transcriptions: for salon orchestra; band;
violin and piano (by Heifetz); three-part woman&rsquo;s chorus; dance orchestra;
marimba and piano; and even a popular song adapted by David
Saperton to lyrics by Stella Ungar.</p>

<h2 id="c70"><span class="small">Edwin Franko <b id="g_Goldman">Goldman</b></span></h2>
<p>Edwin Franko Goldman was born in Louisville,
Kentucky, on January 1, 1878. He came from a distinguished musical
family. His uncles were Sam Franko and Nahan Franko, both prominent in
New York as conductors, violinists, and pioneers in the presentation of
free concerts. Goldman attended the National Conservatory in New
York, specializing in the cornet. After completing his training with
Jules Levey, he served for ten years as solo cornetist of the Metropolitan
Opera orchestra. In 1911 he organized his first band. Seven years later
he founded the famous Goldman Band which from then on gave free
concerts in New York and Brooklyn public parks, and elsewhere on
tour. Under his direction it became one of the outstanding musical
organizations of its kind in the country, presenting a remarkable repertory
of popular music, light classics, and band transcriptions of symphonic
and operatic compositions. Goldman conducted his band until
his death, which took place in New York on February 21, 1956. He was
succeeded by his son, Richard Franko Goldman, who for many years
had served as his father&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<p>For his concerts Goldman wrote over a hundred marches which have
won him recognition as John Philip Sousa&rsquo;s successor. The best of the
Goldman marches won immediate success for their robust tunes and
vigorous beat. These include: &ldquo;Central Park,&rdquo; &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s March,&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the Campus,&rdquo; &ldquo;On the Farm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the Mall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s March,&rdquo; is actually an adaptation for band of several
children&rsquo;s tunes including &ldquo;Three Blind Mice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jingle Bells,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush,&rdquo; presented in march time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c71"><span class="small"><b id="g_KarlGoldmark">Karl Goldmark</b></span></h2>
<p>Karl Goldmark was born in Keszthely, Hungary, on May
18, 1830, the son of a cantor. Demonstrating unusual talent on the
violin, he was sent to Vienna in 1844. There he studied with Leopold
Jansa, then attended the Vienna Conservatory. His musical education
was brought to an abrupt halt by the revolution of 1848. For many years
after that, Goldmark earned his living by teaching music, playing in
theater orchestras, and writing criticisms. He first came to the fore as
a composer with a concert of his works in Vienna on March 20, 1857.
Success followed eight years later with the premi&egrave;re of his concert overture,
<i>Sakuntala</i>. From then on, Goldmark occupied an esteemed position
in Viennese music by virtue of many distinguished works that included
the opera <i>The Queen of Sheba</i>, the <i>Rustic Wedding Symphony</i>,
and various shorter works for orchestra, as well as numerous compositions
for chorus, the piano, and chamber-music groups. He died in
Vienna on January 2, 1915.</p>
<p>Throughout his life he remained true to the Germanic-Romantic
tradition on which he was nurtured. His writing was always vital with
emotion, at times to the point of being sensual; it overflowed with
luxurious melody and harmony. Most of the works by which he is
remembered, while of the serious concert-hall variety, are light classics
because of their charm and grace and pleasing melodic content.</p>
<p>The <i>Bacchanale</i> for orchestra is in Goldmark&rsquo;s identifiable sensual
style. This is an episode from his most famous opera, <i>The Queen of
Sheba</i> (<i>Die Koenigin von Saba</i>), libretto by Solomon Herman Mosenthal
based on the Old Testament story of the love of the Queen of Sheba
for Assad. The opera was successfully introduced in Vienna on March
10, 1875. The <i>Bacchanale</i> takes place at the beginning of Act 3 in which
a sumptuous reception honors the Queen of Sheba. This dynamic piece
of music is especially interesting for its Oriental melodies and lush
orchestral colors.</p>
<p><i>In Spring</i> (<i>Im Fruehling</i>), op. 36 (1889), is a concert overture for
orchestra echoing the composer&rsquo;s emotional reaction to the vernal season.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
The first main theme, in first violins accompanied by other strings,
is given without any preliminaries. The second theme in violins is more
bucolic, the woodwind suggesting bird calls in the background. Both
themes are discussed and stormy episodes ensue. After the return of
the two main themes the overture ends with a brilliant coda.</p>
<p>The <i>Rustic Wedding Symphony</i> (<i>Laendliche Hochzeit</i>), op. 26 (1876)
is a programmatic composition for orchestra in five movements. The
first is a &ldquo;Wedding March&rdquo; in which the main melody (given in fragments
in the lower strings) is subjected to thirteen variations. The second
movement is a &ldquo;Bridal Song,&rdquo; a lovely tune mainly for oboe in
which the first-movement march subject occasionally intrudes in the
background in the basses. This is followed by the third-movement
&ldquo;Serenade,&rdquo; its main subject being a spacious melody mainly for the
violins. The fourth movement, &ldquo;In the Garden,&rdquo; depicts the walk of
two lovers in a garden as they exchange tender sentiments. The symphony
ends with a vital &ldquo;Dance,&rdquo; in which the main theme receives
fugal treatment.</p>
<p>The concert overture for orchestra, <i>Sakuntala</i>, op. 13 (1865)&mdash;with
which the composer achieved his first major success and which is still
one of his most popular works&mdash;was based on the celebrated story of
Kalidasa. Sakuntala is the daughter of a water nymph who is raised by
a priest as his own daughter. The King falls in love with her and marries
her, giving her a ring which will always identify her as his wife.
A powerful priest, seeking revenge against Sakuntala, effects a loss of
memory in the king, who now no longer recognizes her as his wife. To
complicate matters further, Sakuntala has lost her ring while washing
clothes in a sacred river. After being repudiated by the king as a fraud,
Sakuntala returns to her water-nymph mother. The king&rsquo;s memory
is restored when the ring is found, and he is overwhelmed with grief at
his loss of Sakuntala.</p>
<p>A somber introduction is highlighted by a rippling subject in lower
strings and bassoons suggesting the water which was Sakuntala&rsquo;s original
abode and to which she finally returns. After a change of tempo,
clarinets and cellos in unison offer a beautiful love melody. This is
followed by a hunting theme in first violins and oboes while the second
violins and violas present a fragment of the love song as a countersubject.
After this material has been amplified into a loud and dramatic
climax there comes still a third idea, in oboes and English horn against
chords in harp and arpeggios in strings. In a free fantasia section some
of this material is reviewed after which the coda offers the hunting
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
theme, and after that the love melody. A climax is realized with the
hunting theme bringing the overture to a dramatic ending.</p>
<h2 id="c72"><span class="small"><b id="g_RubinGoldmark">Rubin Goldmark</b></span></h2>
<p>Rubin Goldmark, nephew of Karl, was born in New York
City on August 15, 1872. After studying music with private teachers in
New York, he attended first the Vienna Conservatory in Austria, and
after that the National Conservatory in New York where one of his
teachers was Antonin Dvo&#345;&aacute;k. His primary energy was directed to teaching.
For six years he was the director of the Colorado College Conservatory,
and from 1924 until his death head of the composition department
at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. As a composer,
Goldmark is most often remembered for the <i>Negro Rhapsody</i>
and the <i>Requiem</i> for orchestra, the latter inspired by Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg
Address. Goldmark died in New York City on March 6, 1936.</p>
<p>It is with the <i>Negro Rhapsody</i> (1923) that Goldmark is most often
represented on concert and semi-classical concerts. As its title suggests
the work is made up of Negro melodies. After a slow introduction, the
cellos and violas in unison offer the strains of &ldquo;Nobody Knows De
Trouble I&rsquo;d Seen.&rdquo; Before long, the basses are heard in &ldquo;O Peter, Go
Ring Dem Bells.&rdquo; The main section of the rhapsody begins with a
variation of &ldquo;Nobody Knows De Trouble I&rsquo;d Seen&rdquo; and a repeat of
&ldquo;O Peter.&rdquo; The violins then engage &ldquo;Oh Religion, I See Fortune,&rdquo; and
the English horn is heard in &ldquo;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless
Child.&rdquo; After the solo cello quotes two measures of &ldquo;Oh, When I Come
to Die,&rdquo; the last Negro melody of the rhapsody appears. This melody
comes from an untitled song found by Goldmark in a magazine, a tune
sung by Tennessee Negroes while working on the river.</p>

<h2 id="c73"><span class="small">Fran&ccedil;ois <b id="g_Gossec">Gossec</b></span></h2>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph Gossec was born in Vergni&egrave;s, Belgium,
on January 17, 1734. After receiving some music instruction in
his native town, he came to Paris in 1751, and three years after that was
attached to the musical forces employed by La Pouplini&egrave;re. For these
concerts, Gossec wrote many symphonies and chamber-music works. He
later worked in a similar capacity for the Prince de Conti. In 1770 he
founded the Concerts des Amateurs, in 1773 became director of the
Concert Spirituel, and from 1780 to 1785 was conductor at the Paris
Op&eacute;ra. When the Paris Conservatory was established in 1795 Gossec
became Inspector and professor of composition. In the same year he also
became a member of the newly founded Institut de France. During the
French Revolution he wrote many works celebrating events growing
out of that political upheaval, allying himself with the new regime.
He lived to a ripe old age, spending the last years of his life in retirement
in Passy. He died in Paris on February 16, 1829.</p>
<p>Gossec was a significant pioneer of French orchestral and chamber
music, though little of his music is remembered. What remains alive,
however, is a graceful trifle: the Gavotte, one of the most popular pieces
ever written in that form. This music comes from one of his operas,
<i>Rosina</i> (1786); a transcription for violin and piano by Willy Burmeister
is famous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c74"><span class="small">Louis <b id="g_Gottschalk">Gottschalk</b></span></h2>
<p>Louis Moreau Gottschalk was born in New Orleans
on May 8, 1829. His music study took place in Paris where he
specialized in the piano. He gave many successful concerts as pianist in
France, Switzerland and Spain before returning to the United States
in 1853. He then began the first of many tours of the country, to become
the first significant American-born piano virtuoso. At his concerts
he featured many of his own works; his reputation as a composer was
second only to that as virtuoso. He was on tour of South America when
he was stricken by yellow fever. He died in Rio de Janeiro on December
18, 1869.</p>
<p>Gottschalk was the composer of numerous salon pieces for the piano,
enormously popular in his day&mdash;a favorite of young pianists everywhere.
One of these pieces is &ldquo;The Banjo,&rdquo; familiar on semi-classical programs
in orchestral arrangements. In his music Gottschalk often employed
either Spanish or native American idioms.</p>
<p>The contemporary American composer, Ulysses Kay, used several of
Gottschalk&rsquo;s piano pieces for a ballet score, <i>Cakewalk</i>. This ballet, with
choreography by Ruthanna Boris based on the minstrel show, was introduced
by the New York City Ballet in New York on June 12, 1951. The
dancers here translate the routines of the old minstrel show into dance
forms and idioms. An orchestral suite, derived from this ballet score,
has five sections: &ldquo;Grand Walkaround,&rdquo; in which the performers strut
around the stage led by the interlocutor; &ldquo;Wallflower Waltz,&rdquo; music to
a slow, sad dance performed solo by a lonely girl; &ldquo;Sleight of Feet,&rdquo; a
rhythmic specialty accompanying feats of magic performed by the Interlocutor;
&ldquo;Perpendicular Points,&rdquo; a toe dance performed by the two
end men, one very tall, the other very short; and &ldquo;Freebee,&rdquo; an exciting
dance performed by the girl, as other performers accompany her dance
with the rhythm of clapping hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c75"><span class="small">Morton <b id="g_Gould">Gould</b></span></h2>
<p>Morton Gould was born in New York City on December
10, 1913. He received a comprehensive musical education at the Institute
of Musical Art in New York, at New York University, and privately
(piano) with Abby Whiteside. After completing these studies, he
played the piano in motion-picture theaters and vaudeville houses and
served as the staff pianist for the Radio City Music Hall. He was only
eighteen when the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski introduced
his <i>Chorale and Fugue in Jazz</i>, his first successful effort to combine
classical forms and techniques with modern popular American idioms.
In his twenty-first year he started conducting an orchestra for radio,
and making brilliant transcriptions of popular and semi-classical favorites
for these broadcasts. During the next two decades he was one of
radio&rsquo;s outstanding musical personalities, his programs enjoying important
sponsorship. During this period he wrote many works for
orchestra which have been performed by America&rsquo;s foremost symphony
orchestras. He also wrote the scores for several successful ballets (including
<i>Interplay</i> and <i>Fall River Legend</i>), as well as music for Broadway
musical comedies and motion pictures.</p>
<p>Like Gershwin, Gould has been a major figure in helping make serious
music popular by writing ambitious concert works which make a
skilful blend of serious and popular musical elements. Gershwin came
to the writing of serious concert works after apprenticeship in Tin Pan
Alley; Gould, on the other hand, came to popular writing after an
intensive career in serious music. Thus he brings to his more popular
efforts an extraordinary technique in composition, advanced thinking
in orchestration, harmony, counterpoint, and rhythm. Yet there is
nothing pedantic about his writing. Many of his works are such consistent
favorites with audiences because they are the creations of a
consummate musician without losing popular appeal. Few have been
more successful than Gould in achieving such a synthesis between concert
and popular music.</p>
<p><i>American Salute</i> (1942) is a brilliant orchestral adaptation of the
famous American popular song by Patrick Gilmore, &ldquo;When Johnny
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
Comes Marching Home.&rdquo; Though written during the Civil War, this
robust marching song became most popular during the Spanish American
War with which it is today most often associated. Gould prepared
this composition during World War II for an all-American music concert
broadcast over the Mutual radio network on February 12, 1942. &ldquo;I
have attempted,&rdquo; Gould explained, &ldquo;a very simple and direct translation
in orchestral idiom of this vital tune. There is nothing much that
can be said about the structure or the treatment because I think it is
what you might call &lsquo;self-auditory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>American Symphonette No. 2</i> is one of several works for orchestra
in the sinfonietta form in which Gould made a conscious effort to
fuse classical structure with elements of popular music. The composer&rsquo;s
purpose, as he explained, was &ldquo;entertainment, in the better sense of the
term.&rdquo; The most famous movement is the middle one, a &ldquo;Pavane,&rdquo;
often played independently of the other movements. It is particularly
favored by school orchestras, and has also been adapted for jazz band.
The old and stately classical dance of the Pavane is here married to a
spicy jazz tune jauntily presented by the trumpet; there are here overtones
of a gentle sadness. The first and last movements of this Symphonette
abound with jazz rhythms and melodies, respectively marked
&ldquo;Moderately Fast, With Vigor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Racy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Cowboy Rhapsody</i> (1944) started out as a composition for brass
band, but was later adapted by the composer for orchestra. This is a
rhapsodic treatment of several familiar and less familiar cowboy tunes
including &ldquo;Old Paint,&rdquo; &ldquo;Home on the Range,&rdquo; &ldquo;Trail to Mexico&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Little Old Sod Shanty.&rdquo; The composer here attempted &ldquo;a program
work that would effectively utilize the marvelous vigor and sentiment
of these unusual songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Family Album</i> (1951) is one of two suites in which Gould evokes
nostalgic pictures of the American scene and holidays through atmospheric
melodies. (The other suite is <i>Holiday Music</i>, written in 1947.)
The composer explains that the music of both these suites is so simple
and direct in its pictorial appeal that it requires no program other than
the titles of the respective movements to be understood and appreciated;
nor is any analysis of the music itself called for. <i>Family Album</i>,
for brass band, is made up of five brief movements: &ldquo;Outing in the
Park,&rdquo; &ldquo;Porch Swing on a Summer Evening,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nickelodeon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old
Romance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Horseless Carriage Gallop.&rdquo; <i>Holiday Music</i>, for orchestra,
also has five movements: &ldquo;Home for Christmas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fourth of July,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Easter Morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;The First Thanksgiving,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Halloween.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p><i>Interplay</i> is a ballet with choreography by Jerome Robbins introduced
in New York in 1945. The score is an adaptation of the composer&rsquo;s
<i>American Concertette</i>, for piano and orchestra, written for the
piano virtuoso, Jos&eacute; Iturbi. The text of the ballet contrasts classic and
present-day dances; Gould&rsquo;s music is a delightful contrast between old
forms and styles, and modern or popular ones. <i>Interplay</i>, as the concert
work is now called, has four movements, each of popular appeal. The
first, &ldquo;With Drive and Vigor,&rdquo; was described by the composer as
&ldquo;brash.&rdquo; It has two sprightly main themes and a brief development.
This is followed by a &ldquo;Gavotte&rdquo; in which the composer directs &ldquo;a sly
glance to the classical mode.&rdquo; The third movement is a &ldquo;Blues,&rdquo; &ldquo;a
very simple and, in spots, &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; type of slow, nostalgic mood.&rdquo; The
finale, &ldquo;Very Fast&rdquo; brings the composition to a breathless conclusion
through unrelenting motor energy.</p>
<p><i>Latin-American Symphonette</i>, for orchestra (1941) is the fourth of
Gould&rsquo;s sinfoniettas using popular idioms. The three earlier ones exploit
jazz, while the fourth consists of ideas and idioms indigenous to
Latin America. Each of the four movements consists of a stylized Latin-American
dance form: &ldquo;Rumba,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tango,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guaracha,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Conga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Minstrel Show</i> (1946) Gould tried to bring to orchestral music
some of the flavor of old time minstrel-show tunes and styles. There are
no borrowings from actual minstrel shows. All the melodies are the
composer&rsquo;s own, but they incorporate some of the stylistic elements of
the original product. &ldquo;The composition,&rdquo; Gould goes on to say, &ldquo;alternates
between gay and nostalgic passages. There are characteristic sliding
trombone and banjo effects, and in the middle of the piece the sandpaper
blocks and other percussion convey the sounds and tempo of a
soft-shoe dance. The score ends on a jubilant note.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Yankee Doodle Went to Town</i>, like the <i>American Salute</i>, is the presentation
of a popular American tune in modern orchestration and
harmony. The tune in this case is, to be sure, &ldquo;Yankee Doodle,&rdquo; probably
of English origin which made its first appearance in this country
in 1755. The general belief is that it was used by a certain Richard
Shuchburg, a British Army soldier, to poke fun at the decrepit colonial
troops. For two decades after that the tune was frequently heard in the
Colonies as the means by which British soldiers could taunt Colonials.
Once the Revolution broke out, however, the colonists used &ldquo;Yankee
Doodle&rdquo; as its favorite war song, and it was sung lustily by them when
Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. Gould&rsquo;s orchestration emphasizes
some of the humorous elements in the song, while giving it some freshness
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
and vitality through his fine sense for orchestral color and striking
harmonizations.</p>
<h2 id="c76"><span class="small">Charles <b id="g_Gounod">Gounod</b></span></h2>
<p>Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Gounod was born in Paris on
June 17, 1818. He received his academic education at the Lyc&eacute;e
St. Louis, and his musical training at the Paris Conservatory with
Hal&eacute;vy and Lesueur among others. In 1839 he won the Prix de Rome.
During his stay in Italy he became interested in church music and completed
several choral works. He turned to opera after returning to Paris,
his first work for the lyric stage being <i>Sapho</i>, successfully produced at
the Paris Op&eacute;ra in 1851. From then on, for many years, he concentrated
mainly on opera, winning world renown in 1859 with <i>Faust</i>. In 1870 he
visited London where he conducted orchestral and choral concerts. During
the last years of his life he devoted himself for the most part to the
writing of religious music. Gounod died in Paris on October 18, 1893.
He is most famous for his operas, and most specifically for <i>Faust</i>, though
<i>Mireille</i> (1864) and <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</i> (1867) have also been highly
acclaimed and frequently given. Gounod was a composer who conveyed
to his music sensitive human values. He was a melodist of the first order,
his lyricism enhanced in its expressiveness through his subtle feeling for
orchestral and harmonic colors.</p>
<p>The <i>Ave Maria</i>, while originally a song, is famous in transcriptions
for solo instruments and also for orchestra. The interesting feature of
this work is the fact that Gounod wrote this spiritual, deeply moving
melody to the famous prayer in Latin, against an accompaniment comprising
the music (without any change whatsoever) of Bach&rsquo;s Prelude
in C major from the <i>Well-Tempered Clavier</i>. The marriage of melody
and accompaniment is so ideal it is difficult to realize that each is the
work of a different composer from a different generation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Gounod&rsquo;s masterwork, the opera <i>Faust</i>, is surely one of the most celebrated
works of the French lyric theater. Many of its selections are deservedly
popular. The opera&mdash;libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel
Carr&eacute; based on the poetic drama of Goethe&mdash;was first performed in
Paris on March 19, 1859. Strange to report, it was originally a failure
with both audience and critics. Not until it was revived in Paris in 1869
did the opera finally win favor; from this point it went on to conquer
the world. One of the reasons for this permanent, if somewhat belated,
success, is the sound theatrical values of the libretto. The opera is
consistently excellent theater, rich with emotion, pathos, drama, pomp
and ceremony. The story, of course, is that of the celebrated Faust
legend. Faust makes a pact with the devil, Mephistopheles, to trade his
soul for the return of his youth. As a young man, Faust makes love to
Marguerite. When she becomes a mother she kills her child. Faust
comes to her prison cell to entreat her to escape, but she does not seem
to understand him. After her punishment by death, Faust is led to his
own doom by Mephistopheles.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous single excerpt from the opera is the rousing
<i>Soldier&rsquo;s Chorus</i> (&ldquo;<i>Gloire immortelle des nos a&iuml;eux</i>&rdquo;) from Act 4, Scene
3. The soldiers, returning from the war, sing out their joy on coming
home victorious. This episode is celebrated in transcriptions either for
orchestra or for brass band. Almost as popular is the captivating Waltz
in Act 2. In the opera it is sung and danced by villagers during a celebration
in the public square (&ldquo;<i>Ainsi que la brise l&eacute;g&egrave;re</i>&rdquo;); this excerpt
is also familiar in transcription.</p>
<p>The Walpurgis Night Ballet Music from <i>Faust</i>, though generally
omitted from the performances of the opera itself, has become a concert
favorite. This music is given in Paris during the first scene of the
last act. The classic queens&mdash;Helen, Phryne and Cleopatra&mdash;and their
attendants are called upon to dance to distorted versions of several of
the opera&rsquo;s beloved melodies. There are here seven dances of which
six appear in the score only with tempo markings: <i>Waltz</i>, <i>Adagio</i>,
<i>Allegretto</i>, <i>Moderato maestoso</i>, <i>Moderato con moto</i>, <i>Allegretto</i>, and
<i>Allegro vivo</i>.</p>
<p>When an orchestral potpourri from the opera is given by semi-classical
orchestra, it includes some other beloved excerpts: Marguerite&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Jewel Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Je ris de me voir</i>&rdquo;), in which she speaks her joy
in finding the casket of jewels secretly placed for her in her garden by
Faust; the rousing <i>Kermesse</i> or Fair Music that opens the second act,
&ldquo;<i>Vin ou bi&egrave;re</i>&rdquo;; Mephistopheles&rsquo; cynical comment on man&rsquo;s greed for
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
gold, &ldquo;<i>Le Veau d&rsquo;or</i>&rdquo;; Faust&rsquo;s hymn of love for Marguerite, &ldquo;<i>O belle
enfant! je t&rsquo;aime</i>&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Chorus of Swords&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>De l&rsquo;enfer qui vient
&eacute;mousser</i>&rdquo;), a vibrant exhortation by the young men of the village who,
sensing they are in the presence of the devil, raise their swords in the
form of a cross to confound him.</p>
<p>The <i>Funeral March of a Marionette</i> (<i>Marche fun&egrave;bre d&rsquo;une marionnette</i>)
is a delightful piece originally written for the piano in 1873, and
after that transcribed by the composer for orchestra. Gounod had hopes
to make it the first movement of a piano suite. When he failed to complete
that suite, he issued the march as a separate piece of music in the
now-famous orchestral version. The opening march music tells of the
procession of pallbearers to a cemetery as they carry a dead marionette.
A brighter spirit is induced as the pallbearers stop off at an inn. Then
the procession continues. The funereal atmosphere of the closing measures
speaks of the ephemeral nature of all life, even the life of a
marionette.</p>
<p>The opera <i>Mireille</i>&mdash;libretto by Barbier and Carr&eacute; based on Mistral&rsquo;s
poem, <i>Mir&egrave;io</i>&mdash;is not often performed. But this is not true of its overture.
The opera was first performed in Paris on March 19, 1864. The
story revolves around the tragic love affair of the Proven&ccedil;al girl,
Mireille, and the basket-weaver, Vincent. The overture opens with a
slow introduction in which a stately idea is offered by the woodwind.
In the main body, the principal melody is heard in the strings while
the subsidiary theme is first presented by the violins. After both ideas
are amplified, a crescendo section leads to the triumphant reappearance
of the first theme in the full orchestra. The overture ends with a short
but spirited coda.</p>
<p>Out of the opera <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliet</i> comes a most charming waltz. The
opera was introduced in Paris on April 27, 1867. The libretto, once
again by Barbier and Carr&eacute;, was based on the Shakespeare tragedy. The
waltz opens the first act, a ballroom scene in the Capulet palace honoring
Juliet. Against the lilting strains of this music, the guests perform
an eye-filling dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h2 id="c77"><span class="small">Percy <b id="g_Grainger">Grainger</b></span></h2>
<p>Percy Aldridge Grainger was born in Melbourne,
Australia on July 8, 1882. After receiving some piano instruction
from his mother he was sent to Germany in his twelfth year to continue
his music study with James Kwast and Ferruccio Busoni. In 1900
he made his debut as concert pianist in London, following which he
made an extended tour of Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and
South Africa. A meeting with Grieg, in 1906, was a significant influence
in Grainger&rsquo;s artistic development. Grieg infected the young man with
some of his own enthusiasm for folk music. The result was that Grainger
now began to devote himself to research in the English folk music of
the past. His orchestral and piano arrangements of many of these folk
tunes and dances, between 1908 and 1912, were responsible for bringing
them to the attention of the music world. In 1915, Grainger made
his debut as pianist in the United States. He has lived in America since
that time, devoting himself to concert work, lecturing and teaching,
besides composition. Grainger died in White Plains, New York, on
February 20, 1961.</p>
<p>In his own music, Grainger reveals the impact that his studies in English
music made upon him: in his partiality to modal writing, to the
contrapuntal technique, to placid lyricism. But it is in his fresh arrangements
of old English songs and dances that Grainger is most famous.
&ldquo;Even when he keeps the folk songs within their original dimensions,&rdquo;
says Cyril Scott, &ldquo;he has a way of dealing with them which is entirely
new, yet at the same time never lacking in taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Brigg Fair</i> is a plaintive melody of pastoral character from the district
of Lincolnshire. It was used by the contemporary British composer,
Frederick Delius, as the basis for his orchestral rhapsody of the
same name (dedicated to Grainger).</p>
<p>The bucolic and ever popular <i>Country Gardens</i> is a &ldquo;Mock Morris,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Mock Morris&rdquo; being an old English dance popular during the
reign of Henry VII and since then associated with festivities attending
May Day. Grainger&rsquo;s original transcription was for piano solo, and only
later did he adapt it for orchestra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p><i>Handel in the Strand</i> is a lively clog dance. <i>Irish Tune from County
Derry</i> is better known as the <i>Londonderry Air</i>, a poignant melody now
known to us through numerous versions other than that originally
made famous by Grainger. The piece, designated as a Mock Morris, is
one of a series in a collection entitled <i>Room Music Tit Bits</i>. &ldquo;No folk
music tune-stuffs at all are used herein,&rdquo; says the composer. &ldquo;The
rhythmic cast of the piece is Morris-like, but neither the build of the
tunes nor the general layout of the form keeps to the Morris dance
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lively <i>Molly on the Shore</i> was first written for piano before being
adapted by the composer for orchestra. <i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Hey</i> is a Mock
Morris and consists of four tunes, two fiddle tunes and two folk songs.</p>
<p>Of Grainger&rsquo;s own compositions three are of general interest. The
<i>Children&rsquo;s March</i> (1917) was written during World War I for the United
States Army Band. &ldquo;This march,&rdquo; says the composer, &ldquo;is structurally of
a complicated build, on account of the large number of different themes
and tunes employed and of the varied and irregular interplay of many
contrasted sections. Tonally speaking, it is a study in the blend of piano,
wind, and percussion instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Passacaglia on Green Bushes</i> has two versions. One is for small orchestra,
and the other for a large one. This composition is built around the
folk melody &ldquo;Green Bushes&rdquo; which remains unchanged in key, line,
and rhythm throughout the work (except for eight measures of free
passage work near the beginning, and forty measures at the end).
Against this melody move several folk-like melodies of Grainger&rsquo;s own
invention.</p>
<p><i>Youthful Suite</i> for orchestra is made up of five sections. Part of this
work was completed in 1902, and part in 1945. The first movement,
&ldquo;Northern March,&rdquo; derives its character from the melodic and rhythmic
traits of the folk music of North England and Scotland. The main
melody here acquires its folk-song character through the use of the
flat-seventh minor scale. &ldquo;Rustic Dance&rdquo; achieves an exotic quality
through the employment of an unusual variant of the F major chord.
&ldquo;Norse Digger&rdquo; is a somber lament in which is mourned the passing of
a dead hero, possibly from an Icelandic saga. &ldquo;Eastern Intermezzo&rdquo; has
an Oriental cast. The repeated use of drum beats and the virile rhythms
were inspired by a reading of a description of the dance of the elephants
in <i>Toomal of the Elephants</i> from Kipling&rsquo;s Jungle Book. This
suite ends with a formal &ldquo;English Waltz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c78"><span class="small">Enrique <b id="g_Granados">Granados</b></span></h2>
<p>Enrique Granados was born in L&eacute;rida, Spain, on July
27, 1867. After completing his music study at Conservatories in Barcelona
and Madrid, and privately with Charles de B&eacute;riot in Paris, he
earned his living playing the piano in Spanish restaurants. In 1898, his
first opera was produced in Madrid, <i>Maria del Carmen</i>. The national
identity of this music was to characterize all of Granados&rsquo; subsequent
works and place him among the most significant of Spanish national
composers. His most famous composition is <i>Goyescas</i>, a remarkable
series of piano pieces inspired by the paintings of Goya; the composer
later adapted this music for an opera, also called <i>Goyescas</i>, which received
its world premi&egrave;re in New York at the Metropolitan Opera on
January 28, 1918. Granados came to the United States to attend this
performance, after which he visited Washington, D.C. to play the piano
for President Wilson at the White House. He was aboard the ship
<i>Folkstone</i>, sailing from Folkstone to Dieppe, when it was torpedoed by
a German U-Boat during World War I on March 24, 1916, bringing
him to his death.</p>
<p>In their rhythmic and harmonic vocabulary, Granados&rsquo; best music
is unmistakably Spanish. Perhaps his most famous single piece of music
is an orchestral &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; from the opera <i>Goyescas</i>. He wrote it
after he had fully completed his score to the opera because the directors
of the Metropolitan Opera filled the need of an instrumental interlude.
This sensual Spanish melody is as famous in various transcriptions
(including one for cello and piano by Gaspar Cassad&oacute;) as it is in
its original orchestral version.</p>
<p>Twelve <i>Spanish Dances</i>, for piano, op. 37 (1893) are also popular.
The most frequently performed of these is the fifth in E minor named
<i>Andaluza</i> (or <i>Playera</i>). Fritz Kreisler transcribed it for violin and piano,
one of numerous adaptations. The sixth in D major is also familiar&mdash;<i>Rondalla
Aragonesa</i>, a jota, transcribed for violin and piano by Jacques
Thibaud.</p>

<h2 id="c79"><span class="small">Edvard <b id="g_Grieg">Grieg</b></span></h2>
<p>Edvard Hagerup Grieg, Norway&rsquo;s greatest composer,
was born in Bergen on June 15, 1843. Revealing unusual talent
for music as a boy, he was sent to the Leipzig Conservatory in 1858.
He remained there several years, a pupil of Plaidy, Moscheles, and
Reinecke among others. In 1863 he returned to his native land where
several of his early compositions were performed. He then lived for
several years in Copenhagen. There he met and became a friend of two
musicians who interested him in Scandinavian music and musical
nationalism: Niels Gade and Rikard Nordraak. Under their guidance
and stimulation Grieg began writing music in a national style, beginning
with the <i>Humoresques</i> for piano, op. 6, which he dedicated to
Nordraak. Grieg also became a sponsor of Scandinavian music and
composers by helping Nordraak organize a society for their benefit. In
1866, Grieg helped arrange in Oslo the first concert ever given over
entirely to Norwegian music; a year later he helped found the Norwegian
Academy of Music. He also served as a conductor of the Harmonic
Society, an important influence in presenting Scandinavian
music.</p>
<p>After marrying Nina Hagerup in 1867, Grieg settled in Oslo to
assume an imperial position in its musical life. He also achieved worldwide
recognition as a composer through his violin Sonata in F major,
the A major piano concerto, and the incidental music to Ibsen&rsquo;s <i>Peer
Gynt</i>. He was the recipient of many honors both from his native land
and from foreign countries. His sixtieth birthday was honored as a
national Norwegian holiday. From 1885 on Grieg lived in a beautiful
villa, Troldhaugen, a few miles from Bergen. Music lovers made pilgrimages
to meet him and pay him tribute. His remains were buried
there following his sudden death in Bergen on September 4, 1907.</p>
<p>Its national identity is the quality that sets Grieg&rsquo;s music apart from
that of most of the other Romanticists of his day. Though he rarely
quoted folk melodies or dance tunes directly, he produced music that
is Norwegian to its core. In his best music he speaks of Norway&rsquo;s geography,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
culture, people, backgrounds, holidays, and legends in melodies
and rhythms whose kinship with actual folk music is unmistakable.</p>
<p>The <i>Holberg Suite</i> for string orchestra, op. 40 (1885)&mdash;or to use its
official title of <i>From Holberg&rsquo;s Time</i>&mdash;was written to honor the bicentenary
of Ludvig Holberg, often called the founder of Danish literature.
The composer also adapted this music for solo piano. Bearing in
mind that the man he was honoring belonged to a bygone era, Grieg
wrote a suite in classical style and with strictly classical forms; but his
own romantic and at times national identity is not sacrificed. The first
movement is a &ldquo;Prelude,&rdquo; a vigorous movement almost in march time.
This is followed by three classical dances&mdash;&ldquo;Sarabande,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gavotte,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Musette.&rdquo; The fourth movement temporarily deserts the 17th and
18th centuries to offer a graceful &ldquo;Air&rdquo; in the manner of a Norwegian
folk song, but the classical era returns in all its stateliness and grace in
the concluding &ldquo;Rigaudon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>In Autumn</i>, a concert overture for orchestra, op. 11 (1865, revised
1888) was Grieg&rsquo;s first effort to write symphonic music. This composition
is a fresh and spontaneous expression of joy in Nature&rsquo;s beauties.
The principal melody is a song written by Grieg in 1865, &ldquo;Autumn
Storm.&rdquo; This material is preceded by an introduction and followed by
a coda in which a happy dance by harvesters is introduced.</p>
<p>The <i>Lyric Suite</i> for orchestra, op. 54 (1903) is an adaptation by the
composer of four numbers from his <i>Lyric Pieces</i>, for piano&mdash;a set of
sixty-six short compositions gathered in ten volumes, each a delightful
miniature of Norwegian life. The first of the four episodes in the <i>Lyric
Suite</i> is &ldquo;Shepherd Lad,&rdquo; scored entirely for strings, music in a dreamy
mood whose main romantic melody has the character of a nocturne.
&ldquo;Rustic March&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Peasant March&rdquo;), for full orchestra, has for its
principal thought a ponderous, rhythmic theme first given by the clarinets.
The third movement is a poetic &ldquo;Nocturne&rdquo; whose main melody
is presented by the first violins. The suite ends with the popular &ldquo;March
of the Dwarfs&rdquo; in the grotesque style of the composer&rsquo;s &ldquo;In the Hall of
the Mountain King&rdquo; from <i>Peer Gynt</i>. This movement alternates a
sprightly fantastic march tune (first heard in the violins) with an expressive
melody for solo violin.</p>
<p>The <i>Norwegian Dance No. 2</i> is the second of a set of four folk dances
originally for piano four hands and later transcribed by the composer
for orchestra, op. 35 (1881). This second dance, in the key of A minor,
is probably the composer&rsquo;s most famous composition in a national
idiom. It is in three parts, the flanking section consisting of a sprightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
rustic dance tune, while the middle part is faster and more vigorous
contrasting music. The other somewhat less familiar, but no less beguiling,
<i>Norwegian Dances</i> are the first in D minor, the third in G
major, and the fourth in D major.</p>
<p>The <i>Peer Gynt Suite No. 1</i>, for orchestra, op. 46 (1876) consists of
four numbers from the incidental music for the Ibsen drama, <i>Peer
Gynt</i>, produced in Oslo in 1876. Ibsen&rsquo;s epic is a picaresque drama
about a capricious and at times spirited Norwegian peasant named Peer,
and his fabulous adventures, some of them amatory. He abducts the
bride, Solveig, then deserts her; as an outlaw he roams the world; when
he returns home he finds Solveig still believing in him and through that
belief he comes upon salvation.</p>
<p>The first movement of Suite No. 1 is a bucolic picture, &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo;
in which a barcarolle-type melody is prominent. This is followed by
a tender elegy for muted strings, &ldquo;Ase&rsquo;s Death,&rdquo; Ase being Peer Gynt&rsquo;s
mother. A capricious, sensual dance follows, &ldquo;Anitra&rsquo;s Dance,&rdquo; a
mazurka-like melody with an Oriental identity. The final movement,
&ldquo;In the Hall of the Mountain King&rdquo; is a grotesque march built from a
four-measure phrase which grows in volume and intensity until it
evolves into a thunderous fortissimo.</p>
<p>Grieg prepared a second suite from his incidental music for <i>Peer
Gynt</i>, op. 55. Only one movement from this set is popular, &ldquo;Solveig&rsquo;s
Song,&rdquo; a haunting Norwegian song for muted strings portraying Solveig,
the abducted bride who thereafter remains forever faithful to
Peer Gynt. This is the final movement of a suite whose preceding
movements are &ldquo;Ingrid&rsquo;s Lament,&rdquo; &ldquo;Arabian Dance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peer Gynt&rsquo;s
Homecoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Sigurd Jorsalfar</i>, a suite for orchestra, op. 56 (1872, revised 1892) also
comes from the incidental music to a play, in this case a historical drama
of the same name by Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson, produced in Oslo in 1872.
The central character is the twelfth-century Norwegian king, Sigurd,
who joins the Crusades to fight heroically against the Saracens. There
are three movements to this suite. The first &ldquo;Prelude&rdquo; is subtitled &ldquo;In
the King&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; and has three distinct sections. In the first of these
the main thought is a theme for clarinets and bassoons against plucked
strings; in the second, a trio, the most prominent melody is that for
flute imitated by the oboe; the third part repeats the first. The second
movement is &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Borghild&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo; This is serene music
alternated by an agitated mood. The finale is &ldquo;March of Homage&rdquo; in
which trumpet fanfares and a loud chord for full orchestra set the stage
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
for the main theme, in four cellos. This same theme is later proclaimed
triumphantly by the full orchestra. Midway there appears a trio in
which the first violins offer the main melody.</p>
<p><i>Two Elegiac Melodies</i>, for string orchestra, op. 34 (1880) are adaptations
of two of the composer&rsquo;s most famous songs found in op. 33,
&ldquo;Heartwounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Last Spring,&rdquo; lyrics by A. O. Vinje. Both
melodies are for the most part in a somber mood. The first is in a comparatively
fast time while the second is in slow tempo.</p>
<p><i>Two Northern Melodies</i>, for string orchestra, op. 63 (1895) is, as the
title indicates, in two sections. The first, &ldquo;In the Style of a Folksong,&rdquo;
offers its main melody in the cellos after a short introduction. The second,
&ldquo;The Cowherd&rsquo;s Tune,&rdquo; begins with a slow, simple tune and ends
with a delightful peasant dance.</p>
<p>The Broadway operetta, <i>Song of Norway</i>, was not only based upon
episodes in the life of Grieg but also makes extensive use of Grieg&rsquo;s
music. The book is by Milton Lazarus based on a play by Homer Curran,
and the lyrics and music are by Robert Wright and George Forrest.
The operetta opened on Broadway on August 21, 1944 (Lawrence
Brooks played Grieg, and Helena Bliss his wife, Nina) to accumulate
the impressive run of 860 performances. Since the operetta has become
something of a classic of our popular theater through frequent revivals&mdash;and
since its music is sometimes heard on concerts of semi-classical
music&mdash;it deserves consideration. The story centers mainly around the
love affair of Grieg and Nina Hagerup, and their ultimate marriage; it
also carries the composer from obscurity to world fame. Wright and
Forrest reached into the storehouse of Grieg&rsquo;s music for their songs.
&ldquo;Strange Music,&rdquo; which became a popular-song hit in 1944 and 1945, is
based on one of Grieg&rsquo;s <i>Lyric Pieces</i> for piano, <i>Wedding Day in Troldhaugen</i>.
&ldquo;I Love You&rdquo; is based on Grieg&rsquo;s famous song of the same name
(&ldquo;<i>Ich liebe Dich</i>&rdquo;) which he actually wrote to express his love for Nina;
the lyric was by Hans Andersen, and the song appeared in a set of four
collected in op. 5 (1864). Musical episodes from Grieg&rsquo;s G major Violin
Sonata, the <i>Peer Gynt Suite</i>, <i>Norwegian Dance No. 2</i>, the A minor
Piano Concerto, and some of the piano pieces provided further material
for popular songs and ballet music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c80"><span class="small">Ferde <b id="g_Grofe">Grof&eacute;</b></span></h2>
<p>Ferde Grof&eacute; was born Ferdinand Rudolph Von Grof&eacute; in
New York City on March 27, 1892. He began to study the violin and
piano early. During his adolescence he became a member of the viola
section of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. While engaged in serious
music he started playing with jazz ensembles. Before long he formed
one of his own, for which he made all the arrangements, and whose performances
attracted considerable interest among jazz devotees. Paul
Whiteman was one of those who was impressed by Grof&eacute;&rsquo;s brand of
jazz. In 1919 he hired Grof&eacute; to play the piano in, and make all the
arrangements for, the Paul Whiteman Orchestra. Grof&eacute; worked for
Whiteman for a dozen years, a period during which he prepared most
of the arrangements used by Whiteman, including that of George
Gershwin&rsquo;s historic <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> at its world premi&egrave;re in 1924.
In 1924, Grof&eacute; wrote his first symphonic composition in a jazz style,
<i>Broadway at Night</i>. One year later, came the <i>Mississippi Suite</i>, his first
success. In 1931 he scored a triumph with the <i>Grand Canyon Suite</i>,
still his most celebrated composition. After 1931, Grof&eacute; toured the
country as conductor of his own orchestra, making numerous appearances
in public and over the radio. From 1939 to 1942 he taught orchestration
at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and in 1941 he
began an eight-year contract with the Standard Oil Company of California
to conduct the San Francisco Symphony over the radio. Grof&eacute;
has also written music for motion pictures and special works for
industry.</p>
<p>With Gershwin, Grof&eacute; has been an outstanding composer of symphonic
music utilizing jazz and other popular styles and idioms. He
is distinguished for his remarkable skill at orchestration, which frequently
employs non-musical devices for special effects&mdash;for example, a
typewriter in <i>Tabloid</i>, pneumatic drills in <i>Symphony in Steel</i>, a bicycle
pump in <i>Free Air</i>, shouts and door-banging in <i>Hollywood Suite</i>, and
the sound of bouncing bowling balls in <i>Hudson River Suite</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Grand Canyon Suite</i> (1931), Grof&eacute;&rsquo;s most significant composition
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
as well as the most famous, is an orchestral description in five movements
of one of America&rsquo;s natural wonders. The first movement, &ldquo;Sunrise,&rdquo;
opens with a timpani roll to suggest the break of dawn over the
canyon. The main melody depicting the sunrise itself is heard in muted
trumpet against a chordal background. As the movement progresses, the
music becomes increasingly luminous, until the sun finally erupts into
full resplendence. &ldquo;The Painted Desert&rdquo; is an atmospheric tone picture.
Nebulous chords suggest an air of mystery before a sensual
melodic section unfolds. &ldquo;On the Trail&rdquo; is the most popular movement
of the suite, having for many years been expropriated as the identifying
theme-signature for the Philip Morris radio program. An impulsive,
restless rhythm brings us a picture of a jogging burro. A cowboy tune
is then set contrapuntally against this rhythm. In &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo; animal
calls precede a poignant melody that speaks about the peace and
serenity that descend on the canyon at sunset. &ldquo;Cloudburst&rdquo; is the concluding
movement in which a violent storm erupts, lashes the canyon
with its fury, and then subsides. Tranquillity now returns, and the canyon
is once more surrounded by breathless and quiet beauty.</p>
<p>The <i>Hudson River Suite</i> (1955) was written for Andr&eacute; Kostelanetz,
the conductor, who introduced the work in Washington, D.C. This
music provides five different aspects of the mighty river in New York,
and its associations with American history. The river itself is described
in the opening movement, &ldquo;The River.&rdquo; This is followed by a portrait
of Henry Hudson. The colonial times and the land of Rip Van Winkle
are discussed in the third movement, &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle,&rdquo; while in
&ldquo;Albany Night Boat,&rdquo; a delightful account is given of New York in
years gone by, when a holiday trip on the boat was a favorite pastime of
New York couples. The suite ends with &ldquo;New York&rdquo; a graphic etching
of the metropolis along the Hudson.</p>
<p>The <i>Mississippi Suite</i> (1925)&mdash;like its eminent successor, the <i>Grand
Canyon Suite</i>&mdash;was written for Paul Whiteman, who introduced it in
Carnegie Hall. The first movement, &ldquo;Father of the Waters&rdquo; has a
melody of an American-Indian identity representing the river. In
&ldquo;Huckleberry Finn,&rdquo; the character of the boy is suggested by a jazz
motive in the tuba, later amplified into a spacious jazz melody for
strings. &ldquo;Old Creole Days&rdquo; highlights a Negro melody in muted trumpet
soon taken over by different sections of the orchestra. The closing
movement is the suite&rsquo;s best known section and the composer&rsquo;s own
favorite among his compositions. Called &ldquo;Mardi Gras&rdquo; it is a lively and
colorful picture of carnival time in New Orleans. A rhythmic passage
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
with which the movement opens serves as the preface to an eloquent
melody for strings.</p>
<h2 id="c81"><span class="small">David <b id="g_Guion">Guion</b></span></h2>
<p>David Wendell Fentress Guion was born in
Ballinger, Texas, on December 15, 1895. He received his musical training
at the piano with local teachers and with Leopold Godowsky in
Vienna. After returning to the United States he filled several posts as
teacher of music in Texas, and from 1925 to 1928 taught piano at the
Chicago Music College. Early in the 1930&rsquo;s he appeared in a cowboy
production featuring his own music at the Roxy Theater in New York
and soon thereafter made weekly broadcasts over the National Broadcasting
Company network. A David Guion Week was celebrated
throughout Texas in 1950.</p>
<p>He is best known for his skilful arrangements and transcriptions of
Western folk songs and Negro Spirituals, some of which first became
famous in his versions. His orchestral adaptation of &ldquo;The Arkansas
Traveler&rdquo; has long been a favorite on &ldquo;pop&rdquo; concerts. A familiar legend
helped to dramatize this American folk song to many. A traveler caught
in the rain stops outside an Arkansas hut where an old man is playing
part of a folk tune on his fiddle. Upon questioning him the traveler
learns that the old fiddler does not know the rest of the song, whereupon
the stranger takes the fiddle from him and completes it. The
two then become devoted friends.</p>
<p>Even more famous is David Guion&rsquo;s arrangement of &ldquo;Home on the
Range,&rdquo; in 1930. It is not quite clear who actually wrote this song. It
was discovered by John A. Lomax who heard it sung by a Texan saloon
keeper, recorded it, and published it in his 1910 edition of <i>Cowboy
Songs</i>. Only after Guion had arranged it did it become a national
favorite over the radio, its popularity no doubt immensely enhanced by
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
the widely circulated story that this was President Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s
favorite song.</p>
<p>Guion&rsquo;s concert arrangement for full orchestra of &ldquo;Turkey in the
Straw&rdquo; is also of interest. This folk tune&mdash;sometimes known as &ldquo;Zip
Coon&rdquo;&mdash;first achieved popularity on the American musical stage in the
era before the minstrel show. It was published in Baltimore in 1834
and first made popular that year by Bob Farrell at the Bowery Theater.
After that it was a familiar routine of the black-faced entertainer,
George Washington Dixon. Several have laid claim to the song, but it
is most likely derived from an English or Irish melody.</p>
<p>Other arrangements and transcriptions by Guion include &ldquo;Nobody
Knows De Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ride Cowboy Ride,&rdquo; &ldquo;Short&rsquo;nin&rsquo; Bread,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guion has also written several compositions of his own in which the
folk element is pronounced. One of these is named <i>Alley Tunes</i>, three
musical scenes from the South. Its most famous movement is the last,
&ldquo;The Harmonica Player,&rdquo; but the earlier two are equally appealing for
their homespun melodies and vigorous national identity: &ldquo;Brudder
Sinkiller and His Flock of Sheep&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lonesome Whistler.&rdquo;
Another pleasing orchestral composition by Guion is a waltz suite
entitled <i>Southern Nights</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c82"><span class="small">Johan <b id="g_Halvorsen">Halvorsen</b></span></h2>
<p>Johan Halvorsen was born in Drammen, Norway, on
March 15, 1864. After attending the Stockholm Conservatory he studied
the violin with Adolf Brodsky in Leipzig and C&eacute;sar Thomson in
Belgium. In 1892 he returned to his native land. For many years he was
the distinguished conductor of the Oslo National Theater. His admiration
of Grieg (whose niece he married) directed him toward musical
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
nationalism, a style in which many of his most ambitious works were
written. He was the composer of three symphonies, two rhapsodies, a
festival overture, several suites, and a number of peasant dances all for
orchestra. He died in Oslo on December 4, 1935.</p>
<p>The <i>Andante religioso</i>, in G minor, for violin and orchestra, is a
richly melodious and spiritual work which has gained recognition with
semi-classical orchestras. But Halvorsen&rsquo;s most popular composition is
the <i>Triumphant Entry of the Boyars</i>, for orchestra. The boyar or
boyard was a military aristocrat of ancient Russia, a tyrant as notorious
for his cruelty as for his extravagant way of life. Halvorsen&rsquo;s vigorous,
colorful march has an Oriental personality. It opens with a stirring
march subject for clarinet against a drone bass in cellos and double
basses, and it highlights a fanfare for trumpets and trombones.</p>
<h2 id="c83"><span class="small">George Frederick <b id="g_Handel">Handel</b></span></h2>
<p>George Frederick Handel was born in Halle, Saxony,
on February 23, 1685. After studying the organ in his native city
he settled in Hamburg where he wrote, and in 1705 had produced,
his first operas, <i>Almira</i> and <i>Nero</i>. A period of travel and study in Italy
followed, during which he was influenced by the Italian instrumental
music of that period. In 1710 he was appointed Kapellmeister in Hanover.
In 1712 he settled permanently in England where in 1727 he became
a British subject and Anglicized his name. He became one of
England&rsquo;s giant figures in music, first as a composer of operas in the
Italian style, and after that (when the vogue for such operas died out)
as a creator of oratorios. For several years he was the court composer for
Queen Anne and royal music master for George I. In 1720 he was
appointed artistic director of the then newly organized Royal Academy
of Music. In the last years of his life he suffered total blindness, notwithstanding
which fact he continued giving public performances at
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
the organ, conducting his oratorios, and writing music. He died in London
on April 14, 1759 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>Handel was a prolific composer of operas, oratorios, orchestral music,
concertos for solo instruments and orchestra, sonatas, compositions for
harpsichord, and chamber works. He was greatest in his religious music,
in the deservedly world-famous oratorio <i>Messiah</i>, and in such somewhat
less familiar but no less distinguished works as <i>Judas Maccabaeus</i>, <i>Samson</i>,
<i>Solomon</i>, and <i>Israel in Egypt</i>. His greatest music is on such a consistently
high spiritual plane, is filled with such grandeur of expression,
and reveals such extraordinary contrapuntal skill that it does not
easily lend itself to popular consumption. But one passage from the
<i>Messiah</i> is particularly famous, and especially popular with people
the world over; it is probably the most celebrated single piece of music
he ever wrote, and while originally for chorus and orchestra, is familiar
in innumerable transcriptions for orchestra or for band. It is the sublime
&ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus,&rdquo; about which the composer himself said
when he finished writing it: &ldquo;I did think I did see all Heaven before
me, and the great God himself.&rdquo; This grandiose choral passage, a
miracle of contrapuntal technique, is undoubtedly the climactic point
of the entire oratorio. When the <i>Messiah</i> was first heard in London on
March 23, 1743 (a little less than a year after its world premi&egrave;re which
took place in Dublin, Ireland, on April 13, 1742) the awesome immensity
of this music made such an impression on King George II, in
the audience, that he rose spontaneously in his seat and remained
standing throughout the piece. The audience followed their king in
listening to the music in a standing position. Since then it has been a
custom in performances of <i>Messiah</i> for the audience to rise during the
singing of the &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Harmonious Blacksmith</i> is Handel&rsquo;s best known composition
for the harpsichord. This is the fourth movement of a harpsichord suite,
No. 5 in E major, which the composer wrote in 1720; but most frequently
it is played apart from the rest of the movements as a self-sufficient
composition. The title <i>Harmonious Blacksmith</i> was created
not by the composer but by a publisher in Bath, England, when in
1822 he issued the fourth movement of the suite as a separate piece of
music. There happened to be in Bath a blacksmith who often sang this
Handel tune and who came to be known in that town as the &ldquo;harmonious
blacksmith.&rdquo; The Bath publisher recognized the popular appeal of
a title like &ldquo;Harmonious Blacksmith&rdquo; and decided to use it for this
music. The story that Handel conceived this tune while waiting in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
blacksmith&rsquo;s shop during a storm is, however, apocryphal. The <i>Harmonious
Blacksmith</i> begins with a simple two-part melody which then
undergoes five equally elementary variations.</p>
<p>The <i>Largo</i>, so familiar as an instrumental composition in various
transcriptions, is really an aria from one of Handel&rsquo;s operas. It was a
tenor aria (&ldquo;<i>Ombrai mai fu</i>&rdquo;) from <i>Serse</i> (1738) in which is described
the beauty of the cool shade of a palm tree. In slower tempo it has
become, in its instrumental dress, a broad, stately melody of religious
character with the simple tempo marking of <i>Largo</i> as its title.</p>
<p>The <i>Water Music</i> (1717) is a suite for orchestra made up of charming
little dances, airs and fanfares written for a royal water pageant
held on the Thames River in London on July 19, 1717. A special barge
held the orchestra that performed this composition while the musicians
sailed slowly up and down the river. The king was so impressed by
Handel&rsquo;s music that he asked it be repeated three times. In its original
form, this suite is made up of twenty pieces, but the version most often
heard today is an adaptation by Sir Hamilton Harty in which only six
movements appear: Overture, Air, Bourr&eacute;e, Hornpipe, Air, and Fanfare.</p>
<h2 id="c84"><span class="small">Joseph <b id="g_Haydn">Haydn</b></span></h2>
<p>Franz Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau, Austria, on
March 31, 1732. From 1740 to 1749 he was a member of the choir of
St. Stephen&rsquo;s in Vienna, attending its school for a comprehensive musical
training. For several years after that he lived in Vienna, teaching
music, and completing various hack assignments, while pursuing serious
composition. In 1755 he was appointed by Baron Karl Josef Fuernberg
to write music for and direct the concerts at his palace; it was in this
office that Haydn wrote his first symphonies and string quartets as well
as many other orchestral and chamber-music works. From 1758 to 1760
he was Kapellmeister to Count Ferdinand Maximilian Morzin. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
1761 Haydn became second Kapellmeister to Prince Paul Anton Esterh&aacute;zy
at Eisenstadt, rising to the post of first Kapellmeister five years
after that. Haydn remained with the Esterh&aacute;zys until 1790, a period in
which he arrived at full maturity as a composer. His abundant symphonies,
quartets, sonatas and other compositions spread his fame
throughout the length and breadth of Europe. After leaving the employ
of the Esterh&aacute;zys, Haydn paid two visits to London, in 1791 and again
in 1794, where he directed orchestral concerts for which he wrote his
renowned <i>London</i> symphonies. At the dusk of his career, Haydn produced
two crowning masterworks in the field of choral music: the
oratorios <i>The Creation</i> (1798) and <i>The Seasons</i> (1801). Haydn died in
Vienna on May 31, 1809.</p>
<p>Haydn was an epochal figure during music&rsquo;s classical era. He helped
to establish permanently the structures of the symphony, quartet,
sonata; to arrive at a fully realized homophonic style as opposed to the
contrapuntal idiom of the masters who preceded him; and to arrive at
new concepts of harmony, orchestration, and thematic development.
He helped pave the way for the giants who followed him, most notably
Mozart and Beethoven, who helped carry the classical era in music to
its full flowering. To his musical writing Haydn brought that charm,
grace, stateliness, beauty of lyricism that we associate with classicism,
and with it a most engaging sense of humor and at times even a remarkable
expressiveness. Most of Haydn&rsquo;s music belongs to the serious concert
repertory. He did write some music intended for the masses&mdash;mainly
the Contredanses, German Dances and Minuets which, after
all, was the dance music of the Austrian people in Haydn&rsquo;s time.
Haydn&rsquo;s <i>German Dances</i> and Minuets are especially appealing. The
former was the forerunner of the waltz, but its melodies and rhythms
have a lusty peasant quality and an earthy vitality; the latter was the
graceful, sedate dance of the European court. Twelve of Haydn&rsquo;s <i>German
Dances</i> and twelve of his Minuets (the latter called <i>Katherine
Menuetten</i>) were written in the closing years of his life and published
in 1794; they were intended for the court ball held at the Redoutensaal
in Vienna where they were introduced on November 25, 1792. The
<i>German Dances</i> here have sobriety and dignity, and are often filled with
Haydn&rsquo;s remarkable innovations in melodic and harmonic writing; the
Minuets are consistently light and carefree in spirit.</p>
<p>The <i>Gypsy Rondo</i>&mdash;often heard in various transcriptions, including
one for violin and piano by Fritz Kreisler&mdash;comes from the Piano Trio
No. 1 in G major, op. 73, no. 2 (1795) where it is the concluding movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
(Rondo all&rsquo; ongarese). It is in Hungarian style, vivacious in
rhythmic and melodic content; it is for this reason that Haydn himself
designated this music &ldquo;in a gypsy style&rdquo; and Kreisler&rsquo;s transcription
bears the title of <i>Hungarian Rondo</i>.</p>
<p>Of Haydn&rsquo;s more than one hundred symphonies the one occasionally
given by pop orchestras is a curiosity known as the <i>Toy Symphony</i>.
Actually we now know that Haydn never really wrote it, but it was
the work of either Mozart&rsquo;s father, Leopold, or Haydn&rsquo;s brother,
Michael. But it was long attributed to Joseph Haydn, and still is often
credited to him. This little symphony in C major, which is in three
short movements, was long believed to have been written by Haydn
during his visit to Berchtegaden, Bavaria, in 1788 where he became
interested in toy instruments. The symphony uses numerous toy instruments
(penny trumpet, quail call, rattle, cuckoo, whistle, little drum,
toy triangle, and so forth) together with three orthodox musical instruments,
two violins and a bass.</p>
<p>Joseph Haydn was also the composer of Austria&rsquo;s national anthem,
&ldquo;<i>Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser</i>.&rdquo; He was commissioned to do so in 1797
by the Minister of the Interior to help stir the patriotic ardor of Austrians;
it was first performed in all Austrian theaters on the Emperor&rsquo;s
birthday on February 12, 1797. The Emperor was deeply impressed by
the anthem. &ldquo;You have expressed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is in every loyal
Austrian heart, and through your melody Austria will always be honored.&rdquo;
Haydn himself used the same melody in one of his string quartets:
as the slow second movement in which it receives a series of variations.
It is for this reason that this quartet, in C major, op. 76, no. 3,
is popularly known as the <i>Emperor Quartet</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c85"><span class="small">Victor <b id="g_Herbert">Herbert</b></span></h2>
<p>Victor Herbert was born in Dublin, Ireland, on February
1, 1859. He received a sound musical training at the Stuttgart
Conservatory, following which he studied the cello privately with
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
Bernhard Cossmann in Baden-Baden. For several years after that he
played the cello in many German and Austrian orchestras. His bow as
a composer took place with two ambitious works, a suite and a concerto,
both for cello and orchestra. They were introduced by the Stuttgart
Symphony (the composer as soloist) in 1883 and 1885 respectively. After
marrying the prima donna, Therese Foerster, in 1886, Herbert came to
the United States and played the cello in the Metropolitan Opera
orchestra, his wife having been engaged by that company. He soon
played the cello in other major American orchestras, besides conducting
symphonic concerts, concerts of light music, and performances at important
festivals. In 1893 he succeeded Patrick S. Gilmore as bandleader
of the famous 22nd Regiment Band, and from 1898 to 1904 he was
principal conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony. After 1904 he was
the conductor of his own orchestra.</p>
<p>Herbert won world renown as a composer of operettas for which he
produced a wealth of melodies that have never lost their charm or
fascination for music lovers. His first produced operetta, <i>Prince
Ananias</i>, in 1894 was a failure. But one year later came <i>The Wizard
of the Nile</i>, the first of a long string of stage successes Herbert was henceforth
to enjoy. From then on, until the end of his life, Herbert remained
one of Broadway&rsquo;s most productive and most significant composers.
Many of his operettas are now classics of the American musical
stage. Among these are: <i>The Fortune Teller</i> (1898), <i>Babes in Toyland</i>
(1903), <i>Mlle. Modiste</i> (1905), <i>The Red Mill</i> (1906) and <i>Naughty Marietta</i>
(1910). A facile composer with an extraordinary technique at orchestration
and harmonization, and a born melodist who had a seemingly
inexhaustible reservoir of beautiful tunes, Herbert was a giant
figure in American popular music and in the music for the American
popular theater. He died of a heart attack in New York City on May 26,
1924.</p>
<p>Victor Herbert produced a considerable amount of concert music&mdash;concertos,
symphonies, suites, overtures&mdash;most of which has passed out
of the more serious repertory. A few of these concert works have enough
emotional impact and melodic fascination to enjoy a permanent status
in the semi-classical repertory. Potpourris from the scores of his most
famous operettas&mdash;and orchestral transcriptions of individual songs
from these productions&mdash;are, of course, basic to any pop or semi-classical
orchestra repertory. For Herbert&rsquo;s greatest songs from his operettas
are classics, &ldquo;as pure in outline as the melodies of Schubert and
Mozart&rdquo; according to Deems Taylor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p><i>Al Fresco</i> is mood music which opens the second act of the operetta,
<i>It Happened in Nordland</i> (1904). Herbert had previously written and
published it as a piano piece, using the pen-name of Frank Roland, in
order to test the appeal of this little composition. It did so well in this
version that Herbert finally decided to include it in his operetta where
it serves to depict a lively carnival scene.</p>
<p><i>The American Fantasia</i> (1898) is a brilliantly orchestrated and skilfully
contrived fantasy made up of favorite American national ballads
and songs. It is the composer&rsquo;s stirring tribute to the country of his
adoption. The ballads and songs are heard in the following sequence:
&ldquo;Hail Columbia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Swanee River,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Girl I Left Behind Me,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Columbia the Gem of the Ocean.&rdquo; This composition comes
to an exciting finish with &ldquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; in a Wagnerian-type
orchestration.</p>
<p>The operetta <i>Babes in Toyland</i>, which opened in New York on
October 13, 1903, was an extravaganza inspired by the then-recent success
on Broadway of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. Herbert&rsquo;s operetta drew its
characters from fairy tales, <i>Mother Goose</i>, and other children&rsquo;s stories,
placing these characters in a rapid succession of breath-taking scenes of
spectacular beauty. The complicated plot concerned the escape of little
Jane and Alan from their miserly uncle to the garden of Contrary Mary.
They then come to Toyland where they meet the characters from fairy
tales and Mother Goose, and where toys are dominated by the wicked
Toymaker whom they finally bring to his destruction. Principal musical
numbers from this score include the delightful orchestral march,
&ldquo;March of the Toys,&rdquo; and the songs &ldquo;Toyland&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Do the
Sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Dagger Dance</i> is one of the most familiar pieces in the semi-classical
repertory in the melodic and rhythmic style of American-Indian music.
It comes from Herbert&rsquo;s opera <i>Natoma</i>, whose premi&egrave;re took place in
Philadelphia on February 25, 1911. This spirited Indian dance music
appears in the second act, at a climactic moment in which Natoma, challenged
to perform a dagger dance, does so; but during the performance
she stabs and kills the villain, Alvarado.</p>
<p><i>The Fortune Teller</i> whose New York premi&egrave;re took place on September
26, 1898, is an operetta that starred Alice Neilsen in the dual
role of Musette, a gypsy fortune teller, and Irma, a ballet student.
Against a Hungarian setting, the play involves these two girls in love
affairs with a Hungarian Hussar and a gypsy musician. Hungarian characters
and a Hungarian background allowed Herbert to write music
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
generously spiced with Hungarian and gypsy flavors, music exciting for
its sensual appeal. The most famous song from this score is &ldquo;Gypsy
Love Song,&rdquo; sometimes also known as &ldquo;Slumber On, My Little Gypsy
Sweetheart,&rdquo; sung by Sandor, the gypsy musician, in tribute to Musette.</p>
<p><i>Indian Summer: An American Idyll</i> (1919) is a tone picture of
Nature which Herbert wrote in two versions, for solo piano, and for
orchestra. Twelve years after the composer&rsquo;s death, Gus Kahn wrote
lyrics for its main melody, and for fourteen weeks it was heard on the
radio Hit Parade, twice in the Number 1 position.</p>
<p><i>The Irish Rhapsody</i> for orchestra (1892) is one of several concert
works in which Herbert honored the country of his birth. This work is
built from several familiar Irish ballads found by the composer in
Thomas Moore&rsquo;s <i>Irish Melodies</i>, published in 1807. &ldquo;Believe Me if All
These Endearing Young Charms&rdquo; comes immediately after a harp
cadenza. This is followed by a variation of &ldquo;The Rocky Road to
Dublin,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Ladies&rsquo; Eyes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thamma Hulla,&rdquo; &ldquo;Erin, Oh Erin,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rich and Rare Were the Gems She Wore.&rdquo; An oboe cadenza then
serves as the transition to &ldquo;St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; The rhapsody ends with
&ldquo;Garry Owen&rdquo; set against &ldquo;Erin, Oh Erin&rdquo; in the bass.</p>
<p><i>Mlle. Modiste</i>, introduced in New York on December 25, 1905, is
the operetta in which Fritzi Scheff, once a member of the Metropolitan
Opera, became a star of the popular musical theater. This is also the
operetta in which she sang the waltz with which, for the rest of her life,
she became identified, &ldquo;Kiss Me Again.&rdquo; Fritzi Scheff was cast as Fifi,
an employee in a Parisian hat shop. Her lowly station precludes her
marriage to the man she loves, Capt. Etienne de Bouvray. An American
millionaire becomes interested in her, and provides her with the
funds to pursue her vocal studies. Fifi then becomes a famous opera
star, thereby achieving both the fame and the fortune she needs to gain
Capt. Etienne as a husband.</p>
<p>Early in this operetta, Fifi tries to demonstrate her talent as a singer
by performing a number called &ldquo;If I Were On the Stage,&rdquo; in which she
offers various types of songs, including a polonaise, a gavotte, and a
waltz. The waltz part was originally intended by Herbert as a caricature
of that kind of dreamy, sentimental music and consisted of the melody
of &ldquo;Kiss Me Again&rdquo; which he had written some time earlier, in 1903.
On opening night the audience liked this part of the number so well,
and was so noisy in its demonstration, that Herbert decided to feature
it separately and prominently in his operetta, had new sentimental
lyrics written for it, and called it &ldquo;Kiss Me Again.&rdquo; This, of course, is
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
the most celebrated single number from this operetta, but several
others are equally appealing, notably one of Herbert&rsquo;s finest marches,
&ldquo;The Mascot of the Troop,&rdquo; another waltz called &ldquo;The Nightingale and
the Star,&rdquo; and a humorous ditty, &ldquo;I Want What I Want When I Want
It.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operetta, <i>Naughty Marietta</i>&mdash;first New York performance on
November 7, 1910&mdash;was set in New Orleans in 1780 when that city was
under Spanish rule. The noble lady, Marietta (starring the prima
donna, Emma Trentini) had come to New Orleans from Naples to
avoid an undesirable marriage. There she meets, falls in love with, and
after many stirring adventures wins, Captain Dick Warrington. A basic
element of this story is a melody&mdash;a fragment of which has come to the
heroine in a dream. Marietta promises her hand to anybody who could
give her the complete song of which this fragment is a part, and it is
Dick Warrington, of course, who is successful. This melody is one of
Herbert&rsquo;s best loved, &ldquo;Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life.&rdquo; Other favorites
from <i>Naughty Marietta</i> are &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Falling in Love With Someone,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Italian Street Song,&rdquo; the serenade &ldquo;&rsquo;Neath the Southern Moon,&rdquo; and
the march, &ldquo;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Pan Americana</i> (1901) is a composition for orchestra described by
Herbert as a &ldquo;<i>morceau caract&eacute;ristique</i>.&rdquo; He wrote it for the Pan
American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 (where President McKinley
was assassinated). The three sections are in three different popular
styles, the first in American-Indian, the second in ragtime, and the
third in Cuban or Spanish.</p>
<p><i>Punchinello</i> and <i>Yesterthoughts</i> (1900) are two evocative tone pictures
originally for piano from a suite of pieces describing the natural
beauties of scenes near or at Lake Placid, New York. Herbert orchestrated
both these numbers.</p>
<p><i>The Red Mill</i>, which came to New York on September 24, 1906, was
an operetta starring the comedy team of Fred Stone and David Montgomery
in a play set in Holland. They are two Americans stranded and
penniless at an inn called &ldquo;The Sign of the Red Mill.&rdquo; When they discover
that little Gretchen is in love with Capt. Doris van Damm and
refuses to marry the Governor to whom she is designated by her parents,
they come to her assistance. After numerous escapades and antics they
help her to win her true lover who, as it turns out, is the heir to an
immense fortune. The following are its principal musical episodes: the
main love duet, &ldquo;The Isle of Our Dreams,&rdquo;; &ldquo;Moonbeams&rdquo;; and the
comedy song, &ldquo;Every Day Is Ladies&rsquo; Day for Me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The <i>Suite of Serenades</i>, for orchestra (1924) was written for the same
Paul Whiteman concert of American music at Aeolian Hall on February
12, 1924 in which Gershwin&rsquo;s <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> was introduced.
This is a four movement suite which represented Herbert&rsquo;s only
attempt to write directly for a jazz orchestra, and parts of it are characterized
by jazz scoring and syncopations. Herbert wrote a second
version of this suite for symphony orchestra. In the four movements the
composer skilfully simulates four national styles. The first is Spanish,
the second Chinese, the third Cuban, and the fourth Oriental.</p>
<p>Another familiar orchestral suite by Herbert is the <i>Suite Romantique</i>
(1901). Herbert&rsquo;s vein for sentimental melody is here generously
tapped. The four movements are mood pictures named as follows:
&ldquo;<i>Visions</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Aubade</i>&rdquo; (a beautiful solo for the cellos), &ldquo;<i>Triomphe
d&rsquo;amour</i>&rdquo; (a glowing love duet), and &ldquo;<i>F&ecirc;te nuptiale</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Woodland Fancies</i>, for orchestra (1901) also consist of four
evocative and pictorial mood pictures, this time inspired by the Adirondack
mountains where Herbert maintained a summer home and which
he dearly loved. Here the four movements are entitled: &ldquo;Morning in
the Mountains,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forest Nymphs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Twilight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Autumn Frolics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are individual songs from several other Herbert operettas
that are part of the semi-classical repertory in orchestral transcriptions.
Among these are: &ldquo;The Angelus&rdquo; and the title song from <i>Sweethearts</i>
(1913); &ldquo;I Love Thee, I Adore Thee&rdquo; which recurs throughout <i>The
Serenade</i> (1897); &ldquo;A Kiss in the Dark&rdquo; from <i>Orange Blossoms</i> (1922);
&ldquo;Star Light, Star Bright,&rdquo; a delightful waltz from <i>The Wizard of the
Nile</i> (1895); and &ldquo;Thine Alone&rdquo; from the Irish operetta, <i>Eileen</i> (1917).</p>
<h2 id="c86"><span class="small">Ferdinand <b id="g_Herold">H&eacute;rold</b></span></h2>
<p>Louis Joseph Ferdinand H&eacute;rold was born in
Paris on January 28, 1791. He began to study music when he was
eleven. From 1805 to 1812 he attended the Paris Conservatory where
his teachers included Adam and M&eacute;hul. In 1812 he received the Prix
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
de Rome. Following his three-year stay in Rome he settled in Naples
where he was pianist to Queen Caroline and had his first opera, <i>La
Giovent&ugrave; di Enrico</i>, produced in 1815. After returning to his native
city he completed a new opera, <i>Charles de France</i>, which was successfully
produced in 1816 at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in Paris where, from
this time on, all his operas were given. H&eacute;rold wrote many serious
operas before turning to the field in which he earned his importance
and popularity, the op&eacute;ra-comique. His first work in this genre was
<i>Marie</i> in 1826; his most successful, <i>Zampa</i>, in 1831. He also enjoyed a
triumph with his last op&eacute;ra-comique, <i>Le Pr&eacute; aux clercs</i>, produced in
1832. H&eacute;rold died of consumption in Paris on January 19, 1833 before
reaching his forty-second birthday.</p>
<p>About all that has survived from H&eacute;rold&rsquo;s most famous opera,
<i>Zampa</i>, is its overture, a semi-classical favorite everywhere. <i>Zampa</i>&mdash;libretto
by M&eacute;lesville&mdash;was introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in Paris
on May 3, 1831. The hero, Zampa, is the leader of a band of pirates who
invade an island. He meets Camille and compels her to desert her lover
and marry him. During the marriage festivities the pirate leader
mockingly tries to place a ring on the finger of a statue. The statue
suddenly comes to life and brings Zampa to his doom by drowning.</p>
<p>The overture opens with a robust subject for full orchestra (derived
from the pirates&rsquo; chorus of the first act). A brief pause separates this
section from a slower one in which timpani rolls and loud chords in the
wind precede a stately melody for wind instruments. After some development,
in which the mood becomes dramatic, two new subjects are
heard: the first is a sensitive melody for clarinet against plucked strings,
and the second is a soaring song for the violins.</p>
<h2 id="c87"><span class="small">Jen&ouml; <b id="g_Hubay">Hubay</b></span></h2>
<p>Jen&ouml; Hubay was born in Budapest, Hungary, on September
15, 1858. His father, a professor of the violin at the Budapest Conservatory,
gave him his first violin lessons. Jen&ouml; made his public debut
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
as violinist when he was eleven, then completed his violin studies with
Joachim in Berlin and with Vieuxtemps in Belgium. In 1886 he was
appointed professor of the violin at the Budapest Conservatory, and
from 1919 to 1934 he was its director. Hubay was one of Europe&rsquo;s most
eminent violinists, violin teachers, and performers of chamber music,
the last with the Hubay Quartet which he founded. He died in
Vienna on March 12, 1937.</p>
<p>Hubay was the composer of several operas, four symphonies, four
violin concertos, and many pieces for the violin. He was at his best
when he drew both his inspiration and materials from Hungarian folk
music. Perhaps his best known work is a set of fourteen pieces for
violin and orchestra collectively known as <i>Sc&egrave;nes de la Cs&aacute;rda</i>, or <i>Hungarian
Czardas Scenes</i>. The czardas is a popular Hungarian folk dance
in duple time characterized by quick syncopations, and exploiting alternating
slow and rapid passages. These <i>Sc&egrave;nes</i> are often presented as
orchestral compositions. The fourth, <i>Hejre Kati</i>, is the most popular of
the group, a piece of music electrifying for its rhythmic momentum.
The second, known as <i>Hungarian Rhapsody</i>, and the fifth, <i>Waves of
Balaton</i>, are also familiar. Besides their rhythmic vitality these compositions
are of interest for their sensual melodies, and dramatic contrasts
of tempo and mood.</p>
<p>From Hubay&rsquo;s most famous opera, <i>The Violin Maker of Cremona</i>,
comes a sensitively lyrical &ldquo;Intermezzo,&rdquo; for orchestra. Hubay wrote
this one-act opera in 1894, and it was introduced in Budapest the same
year. The text by Francois Copp&eacute; and Henri Beauclair concerns a
violin-making contest in Ferrari, Italy, in which the prize is the beautiful
girl, Giannina. A hunchback, Filippo, makes the best violin, but he
generously permits Giannina to marry Sandro, the man she really loves.
A transcription of the &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; for violin and piano is popular in
the repertory and bears the title of the opera. The Intermezzo had also
been adapted by Stoll as a composition for voice and orchestra under
the name &ldquo;Lonely Night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c88"><span class="small">Engelbert <b id="g_Humperdinck">Humperdinck</b></span></h2>
<p>Engelbert Humperdinck was born in Sieburg,
Germany, on September 1, 1854. He attended the Cologne Conservatory
where his teachers included Hiller (who was the first to recognize
his talent), Jensen and Gernsheim. After winning the Mozart Scholarship
of Frankfort in 1876, Humperdinck continued his music study in
Munich with Franz Lachner and Rheinberger. In Munich he published
his first important composition, a <i>Humoreske</i> for orchestra (1880). In
1881, he received the Meyerbeer Prize and in 1897, the Mendelssohn
Prize, both for composition. Between 1885 and 1887 he was professor of
the Barcelona Conservatory in Spain and in 1890 he became professor
at Hoch&rsquo;s Conservatory in Frankfort, and music critic of the <i>Frankfurter
Zeitung</i>. He achieved his greatest success as a composer with the
fairy opera, <i>Hansel and Gretel</i>, produced in Weimar in 1893. After
1896, Humperdinck devoted himself exclusively to composition, and
though he wrote several fine operas none was able to equal the popularity
of his fairy-opera. He died in Neustrelitz, Germany, on September
27, 1921.</p>
<p><i>Hansel and Gretel</i> scored a sensational success in its own day; and,
in ours, it is the only opera by which Humperdinck is remembered.
Following its premi&egrave;re in Weimar, Germany, on December 23, 1893,
it was performed within a year in virtually every major German opera
house. In 1894 it came to London, and in 1895 to New York. The text
by Adelheid Wette (Humperdinck&rsquo;s sister) is based on the Ludwig
Grimm fairy tale familiar to young and old throughout the world.</p>
<p>The overture, and two orchestral episodes, are often performed outside
the opera house. The Overture is made up of several melodies
from the opera beginning with the so-called &ldquo;prayer melody,&rdquo; a gentle
song for horns and bassoons. A rhythmic passage then describes the
spell effected by the witch on the children. After this comes the lovable
third-act melody in which the children are awakened by the dewman.
The happy dance of the children from the close of the opera leads back
to the opening prayer with which the overture comes to a gentle conclusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>The <i>Dream Pantomime</i> comes in the second act and is an orchestral
episode in which is described the descent of the fairies who provide a
protective ring around the children, alone and asleep in the deep forest.
The <i>Gingerbread Waltz</i> (<i>Knusperwalzer</i>) from Act 3 is the joyous music
expressing the children&rsquo;s delight after they have succeeded in pushing
the witch inside the oven and burning her to a crisp.</p>
<p>Among Humperdinck&rsquo;s many works for symphony orchestra one is
occasionally performed by semi-classical or pop orchestras. It is the
<i>Moorish Rhapsody</i> (1898) written for the Leeds Festival in England.
The first movement, &ldquo;Tarifa&mdash;Elegy at Sunrise&rdquo; reflects the sorrow of a
shepherd over the decay of the Moorish people. &ldquo;Tangiers&mdash;A Night in
a Moorish Caf&eacute;&rdquo; is a coffee-house scene highlighted by the sensual chant
of a caf&eacute; singer. The suite concludes with &ldquo;Tetuan&mdash;A Rider in the
Desert,&rdquo; depicting a desert ride with a view of Paradise in the distance.
To carry into his music an Oriental atmosphere, Humperdinck modeled
some of his principal themes after actual Moorish melodies, such
as the second theme of the first movement for English horn, and the
main melody for woodwind in the second movement.</p>
<h2 id="c89"><span class="small">Jacques <b id="g_Ibert">Ibert</b></span></h2>
<p>Jacques Ibert was born in Paris on August 15, 1890. He
attended the Paris Conservatory between 1911 and 1919, with a hiatus
of several years during World War I when he served in the French
Navy. In 1919 he won the Prix de Rome. While residing in the Italian
capital he wrote a symphonic work with which he scored his first major
success, the suite <i>Escales</i>, introduced in Paris in 1924. From 1937 to
1955 he was director of the Academy of Rome. During this period he
also served for a while as director of the combined management of the
Paris Op&eacute;ra and Op&eacute;ra-Comique.</p>
<p>Ibert has written many works in virtually every form, which have
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
placed him in the front rank of contemporary French composers.
Many of these compositions are in a neo-classical idiom. Occasionally,
however, he has made a delightful excursion into satire. It is with one
of the latter works, the <i>Divertissement</i> for orchestra (1930) that he has
entered the semi-classical repertory, though to be sure this composition
is also frequently given at symphony concerts. The <i>Divertissement</i>
begins with a short Introduction in which the prevailing mood of levity
is first introduced. Then comes the &ldquo;<i>Cort&egrave;ge</i>.&rdquo; A few introductory
bars suggest two march themes, the first in strings, and the second in
trumpet. After that appears a loud quotation from Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Wedding March&rdquo; from his <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream Suite</i>. The
&ldquo;Nocturne&rdquo; is a dreamy little melody which precedes a delightful
&ldquo;Waltz&rdquo; and a breezy &ldquo;Parade.&rdquo; The finale is in the style of an Offenbach
can-can, with the piano interpolating some impudent dissonant
harmonies.</p>
<h2 id="c90"><span class="small">Michael <b id="g_IppolitovIvanov">Ippolitov-Ivanov</b></span></h2>
<p>Michael Ippolitov-Ivanov was born in Gatchina,
Russia, on November 19, 1859. He was graduated from the
St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1882 where he was a pupil in composition
of Rimsky-Korsakov. From 1882 to 1893 he was associated with
the Tiflis Music School, first as teacher, then as director. In 1893 he
was appointed professor of composition at the Moscow Conservatory
on Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s recommendation, and from 1906 to 1922 he served
as its director. He also distinguished himself as a conductor of opera
in Moscow. He died in that city on January 28, 1935.</p>
<p>Ippolitov-Ivanov&rsquo;s best music profited from his intensive researches
into Caucasian folk music. His principal works have assimilated many
of the Oriental melodic and rhythmic idioms of songs and dances from
that region. His most popular work of all is the <i>Caucasian Sketches</i> for
orchestra, op. 10 (1895). The first movement, &ldquo;In the Mountain Pass,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
brings up the picture of a mountain scene. Horn calls are here used
prominently. &ldquo;In the Village&rdquo; opens with a cadenza for English horn
and proceeds to a beautiful melody for viola set against a persistent
&#8540; rhythm. &ldquo;In the Mosque&rdquo; dispenses with the strings while describing
an impressive religious ceremony. The suite ends with the stirring
&ldquo;March of the Sirdar,&rdquo; a &ldquo;sirdar&rdquo; being an Oriental potentate.</p>
<h2 id="c91"><span class="small"><b id="g_Ivanovici">Ivanovici</b></span></h2>
<p>Neither Ivanovici&rsquo;s first name nor details of his life are known. He was
born in Banat, Rumania, in 1848, distinguished himself as a bandleader
in his native country, and died in Bucharest on April 1, 1905. For his
band concerts he wrote many popular concert numbers. One of these
is the concert waltz, <i>The Waves of the Danube</i> (<i>Donauwellen</i>), written
in 1880, and achieving from the first phenomenal popularity throughout
Europe. The main waltz melody of this set of waltzes was expropriated
by Al Dubin and Dave Franklin for the American popular song
&ldquo;The Anniversary Song,&rdquo; (lyrics by Saul Chaplin), which was effectively
used in the motion picture <i>The Jolson Story</i> in 1946, sung on the
sound track by Jolson himself.</p>
<h2 id="c92"><span class="small">Armas <b id="g_Jarnefelt">J&auml;rnefelt</b></span></h2>
<p>Armas J&auml;rnefelt was born in Viborg, Finland, on August
14, 1869. He studied music in Helsingfors with Ferruccio Busoni
and Martin Wegelius; in Berlin with A. Becker; and in Paris with
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
Massenet. Beginning with 1898, and for several years thereafter, he conducted
opera performances in Viborg and Helsingfors. In 1907 he
settled in Sweden where three years later he became a citizen. There
he became court composer and the conductor of the Royal Opera. After
returning to Helsingfors in 1932, he directed the Opera for four years
and the Helsingfors Municipal Theater for one. He also appeared as
guest conductor of many important Finnish orchestras, distinguishing
himself particularly in performances of music by Jean Sibelius (his
brother-in-law). In 1940, J&auml;rnefelt received the official title of Professor.
He died in Stockholm in June 1958.</p>
<p>J&auml;rnefelt wrote many works for orchestra, including suites, overtures,
and shorter works. One of the last is <i>Berceuse</i> for two clarinets,
one bassoon, two horns, violin solo and strings (1905), a moody and
sensitive piece of music. The romantic main melody appears in solo
violin after four introductory bars for muted strings.</p>
<p>His most popular composition is the <i>Praeludium</i> for chamber orchestra.
It opens with a three-measure introduction for plucked strings.
This is followed by a brisk march subject for oboe which is soon discussed
by other winds, and after that by the violins over a drone bass.
A passage for solo violin leads to the return of the march melody.</p>
<h2 id="c93"><span class="small">Dmitri <b id="g_Kabalevsky">Kabalevsky</b></span></h2>
<p>Dmitri Kabalevsky was born in St. Petersburg on December
30, 1904, and received his musical training in Moscow, at the
Scriabin Music School and the Moscow Conservatory. He was graduated
from the latter school in 1929, and in 1932 he was appointed instructor
there. His first success as composer came in 1931 with his first
symphony, commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of the Russian
revolution; this was followed in 1934 by his second symphony, which
enjoyed an even greater triumph both in and out of the Soviet Union.
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
In 1939 Kabalevsky was elected a member of the Presidium of the
Organizing Committee of the Union of Soviet Composers; in 1940 he
was given the Order of Merit; and in 1946 he received the Stalin Prize
for the second string quartet. He has also written operas, concertos,
additional symphonies, and piano music.</p>
<p>A composer who has always been partial to the more conventional
means and techniques, and has relied heavily on broad and stately
melodies and subjective feelings, Kabalevsky has managed to produce
several compositions that have wide appeal. One is the sprightly <i>Colas
Breugnon Overture</i>. <i>Colas Breugnon</i> was an opera adapted by V. Bragin
from a novel by Romain Rolland; it was first performed in Leningrad
on February 22, 1938. The central character is a 16th-century craftsman&mdash;a
jovial man who enjoys life and has a spicy sense of humor and
a happy outlook on all things. The overture is essentially a study of that
man, consistently gay and sprightly. There are two main melodies, both
of them lively, and both derived from Burgundian folk songs.</p>
<p>Another popular work by Kabalevsky is <i>The Comedians</i>, op. 26
(1938), an orchestral suite made up of selections from the incidental
music to a children&rsquo;s play, <i>The Inventor and the Comedians</i>. The play
is about the varied and picaresque adventures of a group of wandering
performers in various towns and at public fairs. There are ten episodes
in the suite, each in a light, infectious style that makes for such easy
listening that this work is often given at children&rsquo;s concerts. The ten
sections are: Prologue, Galop, March, Waltz, Pantomime, Intermezzo,
Little Lyrical Scene, Gavotte, Scherzo, and Epilogue.</p>
<h2 id="c94"><span class="small">Emmerich <b id="g_Kalman">K&aacute;lm&aacute;n</b></span></h2>
<p>Emmerich K&aacute;lm&aacute;n was born in Si&oacute;fok, Hungary, on
October 24, 1882. He studied composition in Budapest. In 1904 one of
his symphonic compositions was performed by the Budapest Philharmonic,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
and in 1907 he received the Imperial Composition Prize. After
settling in Vienna he abandoned serious composition for light music.
From this time on he devoted himself to and distinguished himself in
writing tuneful operettas. His first success came in 1909 with <i>Ein
Herbstmanoever</i>, presented in New York as <i>The Gay Hussars</i>. Subsequent
operettas made him one of Europe&rsquo;s leading composers for the
popular theaters. The most famous are: <i>Sari</i> (1912), <i>The Gypsy Princess</i>
(1915), <i>Countess Maritza</i> (1924) and <i>The Circus Princess</i> (1926).
In 1938 he left Vienna, and after a period in Paris, he came to the
United States where he remained until 1949. He completed his last
operetta, <i>The Arizona Lady</i>, a few days before his death in Paris, on
October 30, 1953; it was presented posthumously in Berne, Switzerland,
in 1954.</p>
<p>K&aacute;lm&aacute;n&rsquo;s forte in writing music for operettas was in combining the
charm, <i>Gemuetlichkeit</i> and sentiment of Viennese music in general, and
the Viennese waltz in particular, with the hot blood and sensual moods
of Hungarian gypsy songs and dances.</p>
<p><i>The Circus Princess</i> (<i>Die Zirkusprinzessin</i>)&mdash;first performed in Vienna
in 1926, and in New York in 1927&mdash;was set in St. Petersburg and
Vienna during the period immediately preceding World War I. When
Fedora rejects the love of Prince Sergius by insisting she would sooner
marry a circus performer, he seeks revenge by engaging a famous circus
performer to pose as a member of nobility and woo and win Fedora.
After their marriage, Fedora discovers the true identity of her husband,
and leaves him. But she soon comes to the realization she is really in
love with him and promises to come back if he in turn offers to give up
his profession&mdash;a profession she now despises not from snobbery but
because of fears for his safety. Two delightful waltz melodies&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Leise
schwebt das Glueck vorueber</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Im Boudoir der schoensten Frau</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and
an intriguing little melody that recurs throughout the operetta,
&ldquo;<i>Zwei maerchenaugen</i>&rdquo; are the principal selections from this operetta.</p>
<p><i>Countess Maritza</i> (<i>Die Graefin Mariza</i>) is K&aacute;lm&aacute;n&rsquo;s most popular
and successful operetta. It was first produced in Vienna in 1924, and in
New York in 1926. The setting is Hungary in 1922. An impoverished
count, Tassilo, finds employment on the estate of Countess Maritza
under the assumed name of Torok. He falls in love with her, but when
she learns of his real background she feels he is a fortune hunter interested
only in her wealth. About to leave the employ of the countess and
to bid her permanent farewell, Tassilo&rsquo;s fortune suddenly takes a turn
for the better when his aunt, a Princess, comes to inform him that Tassilo
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
is a wealthy man after all, due to her manipulations of his tangled
business affairs. Now convinced that he loves her for herself alone, the
Countess Maritza is only too happy to accept him as her husband.</p>
<p>This score contains some of K&aacute;lm&aacute;n&rsquo;s finest and most beguiling
music in a Hungarian-gypsy style. The most famous song is in this
sensual, heart-warming idiom: &ldquo;Play Gypsies, Dance Gypsies&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Komm
Zigan, Komm Zigan, spiel mir was vor</i>&rdquo;). This number begins with a
languorous, romantic melody that soon lapses into a dynamic Hungarian-gypsy
dance. Austrian waltz-music in a more sentimental manner
is found in three winning songs: &ldquo;Give My Regards to the Lovely
Ladies of Fair Vienna&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Gruess mir die reizenden Frauen im schoenen
Wien</i>&rdquo;), &ldquo;I Would Like to Dance Once More&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Einmal moecht&rsquo; ich
wieder tanzen</i>&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Say, Yes!&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Sag ja, mein Lieb</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p><i>The Gypsy Princess</i> (<i>Die Cs&aacute;rd&aacute;sfuerstin</i>) was first performed in
Vienna in 1915, and produced in New York in 1917 under the title of
<i>The Riviera Girl</i>. The heroine is Sylvia Varescu, a performer in a Budapest
cabaret, who is loved and pursued by Prince Edwin. But the
Prince&rsquo;s father insists that he marry the Countess Stasi. Eventually the
father&rsquo;s heart is softened and he becomes more tolerant towards having
Sylvia as a daughter-in-law when he is discreetly reminded that once
he, too, had been in love with a cabaret singer. The principal selections
from his score include two soaring waltz melodies: &ldquo;<i>Machen
wir&rsquo;s den Schwalben nach</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Tausend kleine Engel singen hab
mich lieb</i>.&rdquo; The score also includes a dynamic Czardas, and a pleasing
little tune in &ldquo;<i>Ganz ohne Weiber geht die Chose nicht</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Sari</i> was introduced in New York in 1914. Pali is a gypsy violinist
who has grown old and is eclipsed at one of his own concerts by his
son, Laczi. Pali throws his beloved Stradivarius into the flames. Since
both father and son have fallen in love with the same girl, the older
man also renounces her. He wants Laczi to have her as well as his
musical success. A bountiful score includes such delights as &ldquo;Love Has
Wings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Own Sweet Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Faithful Stradivari,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Softly Through the Summer Night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c95"><span class="small"><b id="g_KelerBela">K&eacute;ler-B&eacute;la</b></span></h2>
<p>K&eacute;l&eacute;r-B&eacute;la was born Albert von Keler in Bartfeld, Hungary,
on February 13, 1820. He studied law and worked as a farmer before
turning to music in his twenty-fifth year. After studying in Vienna with
Sechter and Schlesinger he played the violin in the orchestra of the
Theater-an-der-Wien. In 1854 he went to Berlin where he became conductor
of Gungl&rsquo;s Orchestra. He was soon back in Vienna to take over
the direction of the famous Joseph Lanner Orchestra. From 1856 to
1863 he conducted an army band, and from 1863 to 1873 an orchestra
in Wiesbaden. He died in that city on November 20, 1882.</p>
<p>K&eacute;ler-B&eacute;la wrote about one hundred and thirty compositions in the
light Viennese style of Lanner and the two Johann Strausses. His works
include waltzes, galops, and marches, a representative example of each
being the waltz <i>Hoffnungssterne</i>, the <i>Hurrah-Sturm</i> galop, and the
<i>Friedrich-Karl</i> march.</p>
<p>His most popular work is the <i>Hungarian Comedy Overture</i> (<i>Lustspiel
Ouverture</i>). It opens in a stately manner with forceful chords and
a sustained melody in the woodwind. But the comedy aspect of this
overture is soon made evident with two lilting tunes for the woodwind,
separated by a dramatic episode for full orchestra. These two tunes
receive extended enlargement. The overture ends with a succession of
emphatic chords.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c96"><span class="small">Jerome <b id="g_Kern">Kern</b></span></h2>
<p>Jerome David Kern was born in New York City on
January 27, 1885. He first studied the piano with his mother. After
being graduated from Barringer High School in Newark, New Jersey,
he attended the New York College of Music where he was a pupil of
Alexander Lambert, Albert von Doenhoff, Paolo Gallico and Austen
Pearce. He received his apprenticeship as composer for the popular
theater in 1903 in London, where with P. G. Wodehouse as his lyricist
he wrote a topical song, &ldquo;Mr. Chamberlain&rdquo; that became a hit. After
returning to the United States he worked in Tin Pan Alley and immediately
became a prolific contributor of songs to the musical stage. In
1905 his song &ldquo;How&rsquo;d You Like to Spoon With Me?&rdquo; was interpolated
into <i>The Earl and the Girl</i> and became an outstanding success. From
that time on, and up to the end of his life, he wrote over a thousand
songs for more than a hundred stage and screen productions, thereby
occupying an imperial position among American popular composers of
his generation. His most famous Broadway musicals were: <i>The Girl
from Utah</i> (1914), <i>Very Good, Eddie</i> (1915), <i>Oh, Boy!</i> (1917), <i>Leave it
to Jane</i> (1917), <i>Sally</i> (1920), <i>Sunny</i> (1925), <i>Show Boat</i> (1927), <i>The Cat
and the Fiddle</i> (1931), <i>Music in the Air</i> (1932), and <i>Roberta</i> (1933).
His most significant motion pictures were <i>Swingtime</i> with Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers, <i>You Were Never Lovelier</i> and <i>Cover Girl</i> both
with Rita Hayworth, and <i>Centennial Summer</i>. Over a dozen of his
songs sold more than two million copies of sheet music including &ldquo;All
the Things You Are,&rdquo; &ldquo;They Didn&rsquo;t Believe Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Smoke Gets In
Your Eyes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Look for the Silver Lining.&rdquo; Two of his songs received
the Academy Award: &ldquo;The Way You Look Tonight&rdquo; from
<i>Swingtime</i> and &ldquo;The Last Time I Saw Paris&rdquo; interpolated into <i>Lady
Be Good</i>. Kern died in New York City on November 11, 1945.</p>
<p>Kern wrote two compositions for symphony orchestra which have
entered the semi-classical repertory even though they are also performed
by major symphony orchestras. These were his only ventures into the
world of music outside the popular theater. One was <i>Mark Twain: A</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
<i>Portrait for Orchestra</i> which he wrote on a commission from Andr&eacute;
Kostelanetz, who introduced it with the Cincinnati Symphony in 1942.
This is a four movement suite inspired by the personality and life of
Kern&rsquo;s favorite author, Mark Twain. The first movement, &ldquo;Hannibal
Days,&rdquo; describes a sleepy small town on a summer morning a century
ago. The cry &ldquo;Steamboat comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; pierces the silence. The town suddenly
awakens. In the second movement, &ldquo;Gorgeous Pilot House&rdquo;
Mark Twain leaves home to become a pilot&rsquo;s assistant on the Mississippi
steamboat; this period in Mark Twain&rsquo;s life, which spans about nine
years, ends with the outbreak of the Civil War. In &ldquo;Wandering Westward,&rdquo;
Twain meets failure as a Nevada prospector, after which he
finally turns to journalism. The suite ends with &ldquo;Mark in Eruption,&rdquo;
tracing Twain&rsquo;s triumphant career as a writer.</p>
<p>Kern&rsquo;s second and only other symphonic work is <i>Scenario</i> in which
he drew his basic melodic materials from his greatest and best loved
musical production, <i>Show Boat</i>. Kern prepared <i>Scenario</i> at the behest
of Artur Rodzinski, conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, who felt
that the music of <i>Show Boat</i> had sufficient artistic validity to justify its
use in a major symphonic work. Rodzinski introduced <i>Scenario</i> in
Cleveland with the Cleveland Orchestra in 1941, and since that time it
has been performed by most of the major American orchestras.</p>
<p>A discussion of <i>Show Boat</i> is essential before <i>Scenario</i> can be commented
upon. The libretto and lyrics are by Oscar Hammerstein II,
based on the famous novel by Edna Ferber. <i>Show Boat</i>, in a lavish
Florenz Ziegfeld production, was introduced in New York in 1927 and
was an instantaneous box-office and artistic triumph. It has, to be sure,
become a classic of the American stage, continually revived in all parts
of the country, three times adapted for motion pictures, and has been
given by an American opera company in its regular repertory. It
proved a revolution in the American musical theater by avoiding the
usual stilted routines and patterns of musical comedy&mdash;chorus girls,
production numbers, synthetic humor, set dances and so forth&mdash;and
arriving at an integrated musical play filled with authentic characterizations,
backgrounds, atmosphere and dramatic truth. The story opens
and closes on <i>Cotton Blossom</i>, a show boat traveling along the Mississippi
to give performances at stops along the river. The principal love
action involves Magnolia, daughter of Cap&rsquo;n Andy (owner of the boat)
and the gambler, Gaylord Ravenal. They run off and get married, but
their happiness is short-lived. Magnolia, though pregnant, leaves her
irresponsible husband. After the birth of Magnolia&rsquo;s daughter, Kim,
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
the mother earns her living singing show boat songs in Chicago where
she is found by her father and brought back to <i>Cotton Blossom</i>. Eventually,
Magnolia and Ravenal are reconciled, and their daughter Kim becomes
the new star of the show boat.</p>
<p>The most famous songs from this incomparable Kern score are:
&ldquo;Only Make Believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why Do I Love You?&rdquo;, both of them love
duets of Magnolia and Ravenal; two poignant laments sung by the
half-caste Julie, a role in which Helen Morgan first attained stardom
as a torch-song performer, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Help Lovin&rsquo; That Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bill&rdquo;
(the latter with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse); and a hymn to the Mississippi
which has acquired virtually the status of an American folk song,
&ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Man River.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Scenario</i> makes extended use of these songs in an integrated piece of
music. It opens with a sensitive passage for muted strings and continues
with a theme for horn; both subjects are intended to portray the
Mississippi River and are the motto subjects of the entire work. The
main melody of this tone poem is &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Man River,&rdquo; first given softly
by violas and bass clarinet. Other major songs of the musical play follow,
among them being &ldquo;Only Make Believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why Do I Love
You?&rdquo;, after which &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Man River&rdquo; is heard for the last time.</p>
<p>Many of Kern&rsquo;s more than a thousand popular songs are now classics
in the popular repertory. They are so fresh and spontaneous in their
lyricism, so inventive in the harmonic background, so filled with charm
and grace that their survival seems assured. Two symphonic compositions
by Robert Russell Bennett are constructed from one or more of
Kern&rsquo;s best known songs. One is <i>Symphonic Study</i>, a tone poem introduced
in 1946 by the NBC Symphony under Frank Black. This work
presents several Kern songs in correct chronological sequence beginning
with &ldquo;They Didn&rsquo;t Believe Me.&rdquo; After that come &ldquo;Babes in the
Wood,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Siren&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Left All Alone Again Blues,&rdquo; &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Man River,&rdquo; &ldquo;Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All the Things
You Are.&rdquo; The second of Bennett&rsquo;s symphonic compositions is the
<i>Variations on a Theme by Jerome Kern</i>, written in 1934 and soon
after that introduced in New York by a chamber orchestra conducted
by Bernard Herrmann. The theme here used for an effective series of
variations is &ldquo;Once in a Blue Moon&rdquo; from the Broadway musical
<i>Stepping Stones</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c97"><span class="small">Albert <b id="g_Ketelby">Ketelby</b></span></h2>
<p>Albert William Ketelby was born in Birmingham,
England, in or about 1885. Precocious in music he completed a
piano sonata when he was only eleven. For six years he attended the
Trinity College of Music in London where he captured every possible
prize. When he was sixteen he became a church organist in Wimbledon,
and at twenty-one he conducted a theater orchestra in London. He later
distinguished himself as a conductor of some of London&rsquo;s most important
theater orchestras, besides appearing as a guest conductor of many
of Europe&rsquo;s major symphonic organizations, usually in performances
of his own works. For many years he was also the music director of the
Columbia Gramophone Company in England. He died at his home on
the Isle of Wight on November 26, 1959.</p>
<p>A facile composer with a fine sense for atmospheric colors and for
varied moods, Ketelby produced a few serious compositions among
which were a <i>Caprice</i> and a <i>Concerstueck</i> (each for piano and orchestra),
an overture and <i>Suite de Ballet</i> (both for orchestra) and a quintet
for piano and woodwind. He is, however, most famous for his lighter
compositions, two of which are known and heard the world over. <i>In a
Monastery Garden</i> opens with a gentle subject describing a lovely
garden populated by chirping birds. After that comes a religious
melody&mdash;a chant of monks in a modal style. <i>In a Persian Garden</i> is
effective for its skilful recreation of an exotic background through
Oriental-type melodies, harmonies, and brilliant orchestral colors.
Ketelby wrote several other compositions in an Oriental style, the best
of which is <i>In a Chinese Temple Garden</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c98"><span class="small">Aram <b id="g_Khatchaturian">Khatchaturian</b></span></h2>
<p>Aram Khatchaturian was born in Tiflis, Russia, on
June 6, 1903. He was of Armenian extraction. He came to Moscow in
1920, and enrolled in the Gniessen School of Music. From 1929 to 1934
he attended the Moscow Conservatory. He first achieved recognition as
a composer in 1935 with his first Symphony, and in 1937 he scored a
major success throughout the music world with his first piano concerto,
still a favorite in the modern concert repertory. As one of the leading
composers in the Soviet Union he has been the recipient of numerous
honors, including the Order of Lenin in 1939, and the Stalin Prize in
1940 and 1942. In 1954 he visited London where he led a concert of his
own music, and early in 1960 he toured Latin America.</p>
<p>Khatchaturian&rsquo;s music owes a strong debt to the folk songs and
dances of Armenia and Transcaucasia. It is endowed with a sensitive
and at times exotic lyricism, a compulsive rhythmic strength, and a
strong feeling for the dramatic.</p>
<p>The most popular single piece of music by Khatchaturian comes from
his ballet, <i>Gayne</i> (or <i>Gayaneh</i>), first performed in Moscow on December
9, 1942, and the recipient of the Stalin Prize. The heroine of this
ballet is a member of a collective farm where her husband, Giko, proves
a traitor. He tries to set the farm afire. The farm is saved by a Red Commander
who falls in love with Gayne after Giko has been arrested.</p>
<p>Khatchaturian assembled thirteen numbers from his ballet score into
two suites for orchestra. It is one of these pieces that has achieved widespread
circulation: the &ldquo;Saber Dance,&rdquo; a composition whose impact
comes from its abrupt barbaric rhythms and vivid sonorities; midway,
relief from these rhythmic tensions comes from a broad folk song in
violas and cellos. &ldquo;Saber Dance&rdquo; has become popular in numerous
transcriptions, including an electrifying one for solo piano. In 1948
Vic Schoen made a fox-trot arrangement that was frequently played in
the United States.</p>
<p>Two other excerpts from these <i>Gayne</i> suites are also familiar.
&ldquo;Dance of the Rose Girls&rdquo; presents a delightful Oriental melody in oboe
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
and clarinet against a pronounced rhythm. &ldquo;Lullaby&rdquo; has a gentle swaying
motion in solo oboe against a decisive rhythm in harp and bassoon;
flutes take up this subject, after which the melody grows and expands
in full orchestra, and then subsides.</p>
<p><i>Masquerade</i> is another of Khatchaturian&rsquo;s orchestral suites, this one
derived from his incidental music to a play by Mikhail Lermontov produced
in 1939. Each of the five numbers of this suite is appealing either
for sensitive and easily assimilable melodies or for rhythmic vitality.
Gentle lyricism, of an almost folk-song identity, characterizes the second
and third movements, a &ldquo;Nocturne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Romance.&rdquo; The first and the
last two movements are essentially rhythmic: &ldquo;Waltz,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mazurka,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Polka.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c99"><span class="small">George <b id="g_Kleinsinger">Kleinsinger</b></span></h2>
<p>George Kleinsinger was born in San Bernardino,
California, on February 13, 1914, and came to New York City in his
sixth year. He was trained for dentistry, and only after he had left
dental school did he concentrate on music. His first intensive period
of music study took place with Philip James and Marion Bauer at New
York University where he wrote an excellent cantata, <i>I Hear America
Singing</i>, performed publicly and on records by John Charles Thomas.
Kleinsinger then attended the Juilliard Graduate School on a composition
fellowship. In 1946 he scored a major success with <i>Tubby the
Tuba</i>. He later wrote several other works with humorous or satiric
content, often filled with unusual instrumental effects. Among these are
his <i>Brooklyn Baseball Cantata</i>; a concerto for harmonica and orchestra;
and the musical, <i>Archy and Mehitabel</i> (<i>Shinbone Alley</i>), which was
produced for records, on Broadway and over television. In a more serious
vein are a symphony and several concertos.</p>
<p><i>Tubby the Tuba</i>, for narrator and orchestra (1942) belongs in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
class of Prokofiev&rsquo;s <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. It serves to familiarize children
with the instruments of the orchestra, but because of its wit and simple
melodies it also makes for wonderful entertainment. It tells the story
of a frustrated tuba who complains that he must always play uninteresting
&ldquo;oompahs oompahs&rdquo; while the violins are always assigned the most
beautiful tunes. In the end Tubby happily gets a wonderful melody of
his own to enjoy and play. All the characters in this tale are instruments
of the orchestra. In 1946 a recording of <i>Tubby the Tuba</i> sold over a
quarter of a million albums. Paramount made a movie of it, and major
orchestras throughout the country presented it both at children&rsquo;s concerts
and in its regularly symphonic repertory.</p>
<h2 id="c100"><span class="small">Fritz <b id="g_Kreisler">Kreisler</b></span></h2>
<p>Fritz Kreisler, one of the greatest violin virtuosos of his
generation, was born in Vienna, Austria, on February 2, 1875. He was
a child prodigy at the violin. From 1882 to 1885 he attended the Vienna
Conservatory, a pupil of Leopold Auer, winning the gold medal for
violin playing. In 1887, as a pupil of Massart at the Paris Conservatory,
he was recipient of the Grand Prix. In 1888, he toured the United
States in joint concerts with the pianist, Moriz Rosenthal, making his
American debut in Boston on November 9. Upon returning to Vienna,
he suddenly decided to abandon music. For a while he studied medicine
at the Vienna Academy. After that he entered military service as an
officer in a Uhlan Regiment. The decision to return to the violin led
to a new period of intensive training from which he emerged in March
1899 with a recital in Berlin. From 1901 on until his retirement during
World War II he occupied a magistral place among the concert artists
of his time.</p>
<p>As a composer, Kreisler produced a violin concerto and a string quartet.
But his fame rests securely on an entire library of pieces for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
violin now basic to that repertory and which are equally well loved in
transcriptions for orchestra. The curious thing about many of these
compositions is that for many years Kreisler presented them as the
genuine works of the old masters, works which he said he had discovered
in European libraries and monasteries, and which he had merely
adapted for the violin. He had recourse to this deception early in 1900
as the expedient by which a still young and unknown violinist could get
his own music played more frequently, besides extending for his own
concerts the more or less limited territory of the existing violin repertory.
His deception proved much more successful than he had dared to
hope. Violinists everywhere asked him for copies of these pieces for
their own concerts. Publishers in Germany and New York sold these
&ldquo;transcriptions&rdquo; by the thousands. As the years passed it became increasingly
difficult for Kreisler to confess to the world that he had all
the while been palming off a colossal fraud. Then, in 1935, Olin
Downes, the music critic of the <i>New York Times</i>, tried to trace the
source of one of these compositions&mdash;Pugnani&rsquo;s <i>Praeludium and Allegro</i>&mdash;now
a worldwide favorite with violinists. Downes first communicated
with Kreisler&rsquo;s New York publishers who were suspiciously evasive.
After that Downes cabled Kreisler, then in Europe. It was only then
that the violinist revealed that this piece was entirely his, and so were
many others which he had been presenting so long as the music of
Vivaldi, Martini, Couperin, and Francoeur among others.</p>
<p>It was to be expected that musicians and critics should meet such a
confession with anger and denunciation. &ldquo;We wish to apply the term
discreditable to the whole transaction from start to finish,&rdquo; one American
music journal said editorially. In England, Ernest Newman was also
devastating in his attack. &ldquo;It is as though Mr. Yeats published poems
under the name of Herrick or Spenser,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Yet, in retrospect, it is possible to suggest that musicians and critics
should not have been taken altogether by surprise. For one thing, as
Kreisler pointed out, numerous progressions and passages in all of these
compositions were in a style of a period much later than that of the
accredited composers, a fact that should have inspired at least a certain
amount of suspicion. Also, when Kreisler presented his own <i>Liebesfreud</i>,
<i>Liebesleid</i>, and <i>Schoen Rosmarin</i> as transcriptions of posthumous
pieces by Joseph Lanner in a Berlin recital, and was vigorously
assailed by a Berlin critic for daring to include such gems with &ldquo;tripe&rdquo;
like Kreisler&rsquo;s own <i>Caprice Viennois</i>, Kreisler replied with a widely
published statement that those pieces of Lanner were of his own composition.
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
The reasonable question should then have arisen that if the
three supposedly Lanner items were by Kreisler, how authentic were
the other pieces of old masters played by the virtuoso?</p>
<p>Besides all this, Kreisler himself provided a strong clue to the correct
authorship in the frontispiece of his published transcriptions. It read:
&ldquo;The original manuscripts used for these transcriptions are the private
property of Mr. Fritz Kreisler and are now published for the first time;
they are, moreover, so freely treated that they constitute, in fact, original
works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The furor and commotion caused by the uncovering of this fraud
has long since died down. It has had no visible effect on Kreisler&rsquo;s immense
popularity either as a violinist or composer. Since then, all this
music has been published and performed as Kreisler&rsquo;s without losing
any of its worldwide appeal.</p>
<p>Among the compositions by Kreisler which he originally ascribed to
other masters in imitation of their styles were: <i>Andantino</i> (Martini);
<i>Aubade proven&ccedil;ale</i> (Couperin); <i>Chanson Louis XIII et Pavane</i> (Couperin);
<i>Minuet</i> (Porpora); <i>Praeludium and Allegro</i> (Pugnani); <i>La
Pr&eacute;cieuse</i> (Couperin); <i>Scherzo</i> (Dittersdorf), <i>Sicilienne et Rigaudon</i>
(Francoeur); <i>Tempo di minuetto</i> (Pugnani).</p>
<p>Perhaps the best loved pieces by Kreisler are those in the style of
Viennese folk songs and dances in which are caught all the grace and
Gemuetlichkeit of Viennese life and backgrounds. Some he originally
tried to pass off as the works of other composers, as was the case with
the already-mentioned <i>Liebesfreud</i>, <i>Liebesleid</i>, and <i>Schoen Rosmarin</i>,
attributed to Lanner. Some were outright transcriptions. <i>The Old Refrain</i>
is an adaptation of a song &ldquo;<i>Du alter Stefanturm</i>&rdquo; by Joseph Brandl
taken from his operetta, <i>Der liebe Augustin</i>, produced in Vienna in
1887. Still others were always offered as Kreisler&rsquo;s own compositions and
are completely original with him: <i>Caprice Viennois</i>, for example, and
the <i>Marche miniature viennoise</i>.</p>
<p>Among other original Kreisler compositions which he always presented
as his own are the following: <i>La Gitana</i>, which simulates an
Arabian-Spanish song; <i>Polichinelle</i>, a serenade; <i>Rondino</i>, based on a
theme of Beethoven; <i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Madrigal</i>; <i>Slavonic Fantasia</i>, based on
melodies of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k; <i>Tambourin Chinois</i>; and <i>Toy Soldiers&rsquo; March</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c101"><span class="small">&Eacute;douard <b id="g_Lalo">Lalo</b></span></h2>
<p>&Eacute;douard Lalo was born in Lille, France, on January 27,
1823. After receiving his musical training at Conservatories in Lille
and Paris, he became a member of the Armingaud-Jacquard Quartet, a
renowned French chamber-music ensemble. In 1848-1849 he published
some songs; in 1867 he received third prize in a national contest for his
opera, <i>Fiesque</i>; and in 1872 he was acclaimed for his <i>Divertimento</i>, for
orchestra, introduced in Paris. Two major works written for the noted
Spanish violinist, Pablo de Sarasate, added considerably to his reputation:
a violin concerto in 1872, and the celebrated <i>Symphonic espagnole</i>,
for violin and orchestra, two years after that. One of his last major
works was the opera, <i>Le Roi d&rsquo;Ys</i>, introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in
Paris on May 7, 1888. In that same year he was made Officer of the
Legion of Honor and sometime later he received the Prix Monbinne
from the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts. In the last years of his life he was
a victim of paralysis. He died in Paris on April 22, 1892.</p>
<p>A composer of the highest principles and aristocratic style, Lalo is
essentially a composer for cultivated tastes. One of his works, however,
makes for easy listening. It is the <i>Norwegian Rhapsody</i> (<i>Rapsodie norv&eacute;gienne</i>),
for orchestra (1875). There are two sections. The first begins
slowly and sedately, its main melody appearing in the strings. Here
the tempo soon quickens and a sprightly passage ensues. The second part
of the rhapsody, ushered in by a stout theme for trumpets, is vigorous
music throughout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c102"><span class="small">Josef <b id="g_Lanner">Lanner</b></span></h2>
<p>Josef Lanner, the first of the great waltz kings of Vienna,
was born in the Austrian capital on April 12, 1801. When he was twelve
he played the violin in the band of Michael Pamer, a popular Viennese
composer of that day. In 1818 Lanner formed a trio which played in
smaller caf&eacute;s and at the Prater. In 1819 the trio grew into a quartet
with the addition of the older Johann Strauss (father of the composer of
<i>The Blue Danube</i>), then only fifteen years old. Soon afterwards, the
quartet was expanded into a quintet. By 1824, Lanner&rsquo;s ensemble was
a full-sized orchestra popular throughout Vienna, heard in such famous
caf&eacute; houses as the <i>Goldenen Rebbuhn</i>, and the <i>Gruenen Jager</i>, as well
as at leading balls and other gala social events in Vienna. The call for
Lanner&rsquo;s music was so insistent that to meet the demand it soon became
necessary to create two orchestras; one led by Lanner, and the other by
the elder Strauss. Lanner remained an idol of Vienna until his death,
which took place in Oberdoebling, near Vienna, on April 14, 1843.</p>
<p>For his various ensembles and orchestras Lanner produced a wealth
of popular Viennese music: quadrilles, polkas, galops, marches, and
more than a hundred waltzes. It is in the last department that Lanner
was most important, for he was one of the first composers to carry the
waltz to its artistic fulfillment. With composers from Mozart to Schubert,
the waltz was only a three-part song form with a trio. Johann
Hummel and Karl Maria von Weber suggested a more spacious design
by assembling several different waltz tunes into a single integrated composition.
Lanner extended this form further. He prefaced each series
of waltzes with an introduction in which the theme of the main melody
was often suggested; after the waltz melodies had been presented, Lanner
brought his composition to completion with a coda which served
as a kind of summation of some of the ideas previously stated. Between
the introduction and the coda came the succession of lilting, lovable,
heart-warming waltz-melodies so remarkable for their grace, elegance,
freshness and poignancy that Lanner has sometimes been described
as &ldquo;the Mozart of the dance.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Lanner always emphasized
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
soaring lyricism where the elder Strauss was more partial to rhythm.
The Viennese used to say: &ldquo;With Lanner, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pray dance, I beg you.&rsquo;
With Strauss it&rsquo;s &lsquo;You must dance, I command you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The form which Lanner finally crystallized, and the style with which
his waltz music unfolded, were adopted by the two Johann Strausses,
father and son, who were destined to bring this type of Viennese music
to its ultimate development. Thus Lanner was the opening chapter of
a musical epoch. He was the dawn of Vienna&rsquo;s golden age of waltz
music.</p>
<p>Lanner&rsquo;s most famous waltz is <i>Die Schoenbrunner</i>, op. 200, his swan
song. Other outstanding Lanner waltzes are: <i>Die Pesther</i>, op. 93, <i>Die
Werber</i>, op. 103, <i>Hofballtaenze</i>, op. 161, <i>Die Romantiker</i>, op. 167, and
<i>Abendsterne</i>, op. 180. &ldquo;With Lanner,&rdquo; wrote H. E. Jacob, &ldquo;the romantic
epoch began for the waltz, and the flower-gardens and green leaves
of Spring penetrated into the ballroom. Lanner&rsquo;s compositions are unsophisticated
and unpretentious, but his waltzes could no more be commonplace
than could a flower.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c103"><span class="small">Charles <b id="g_Lecocq">Lecocq</b></span></h2>
<p>Charles Lecocq was born in Paris on June 3, 1832. For
four years he attended the Paris Conservatory where, as a pupil of
Bazin and Hal&eacute;vy, he received prizes in harmony and fugue. For a
while he earned his living teaching the piano and writing church music.
In 1857 he shared with Bizet the first prize in a competition for one-act
operettas sponsored by Offenbach. This winning work, <i>Le Docteur
miracle</i>, was successfully introduced in Paris that year. After that
Lecocq wrote several light operas which were failures, before he enjoyed
a major success with <i>Fleur de th&eacute;</i> in 1868, first in Paris and subsequently
in England and Germany. His greatest successes came with
two crowning works in the French light-opera repertory: <i>La Fille de</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
<i>Mme. Angot</i> in 1872, and <i>Girofl&eacute;-Girofla</i>, in 1874. Between 1874 and
1900 he wrote over thirty more operettas. He died in Paris on October
24, 1918 after enjoying for almost half a century a place of signal honor
among France&rsquo;s composers for the popular theater.</p>
<p>Lecocq is remembered today mainly for <i>La Fille de Mme. Angot</i> and
<i>Girofl&eacute;-Girofla</i>. The first of these was introduced in Brussels on December
4, 1872. In Paris, where it was given on February 23, 1873, it enjoyed
the formidable run of more than five hundred consecutive performances.
The book&mdash;by Siraudin, Clairville and Koning&mdash;was set in
Paris during the French Revolution. Clairette, daughter of Mme.
Angot, must marry the barber Pomponnet even though she loves the
poet, Pitou. To avoid an undesirable marriage, even at the risk of arrest,
Clairette sings a daring song by Pitou about an illicit affair between
Mlle. Lange (reputed a favorite of Barras, head of the Directory) and a
young lover. When Pitou proves fickle, and is discovered in the boudoir
of Mlle. Lange, Clairette stands ready to forget him completely and to
take Pomponnet as her husband.</p>
<p>The sprightly overture, filled with vivacious tunes and dramatized
by energetic rhythms, is a favorite of semi-classical orchestras. So are
several dances from the operetta, including an electrifying Can-Can,
and a sweeping <i>Grand Valse</i> with which the second act comes to an exciting
close. The main vocal excerpts are Pomponnet&rsquo;s passionate
avowal of Clairette&rsquo;s innocence, &ldquo;<i>Elle est tellement innocente</i>&rdquo; and the
duet of Mlle. Lange and Clairette, &ldquo;<i>Jours fortun&eacute;s de notre enfance</i>&rdquo;
both from Act 2.</p>
<p><i>Girofl&eacute;-Girofla</i>&mdash;book by Vanloo and Leterrier&mdash;was introduced in
Brussels on March 21, 1874. Girofl&eacute; and Girofla are twin sisters. Girofl&eacute;
is pressured by her parents to marry the banker, Marasquin; Girofla is
in love with an impoverished fire-eating Moor, Mourzouk. When Girofla
is secretly abducted by pirates, the Moor comes to her home demanding
to see her, only to mistake Girofl&eacute; for Girofla. The complicated situation
ensuing becomes resolved only after Girofla is rescued and
brought back home.</p>
<p>The most frequently heard excerpts from this gay score are the
Pirates&rsquo; Chorus, &ldquo;<i>Parmi les choses</i>&rdquo;; the rousing drinking song, &ldquo;<i>Le
Punche scintille</i>&rdquo;; the ballad, &ldquo;<i>Lorsque la journ&eacute;e est finie</i>&rdquo;; and the
love duet, &ldquo;<i>O Ciel!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c104"><span class="small">Ernesto <b id="g_Lecuona">Lecuona</b></span></h2>
<p>Ernesto Lecuona was born in Havana, Cuba, on August
7, 1896. As a boy of eleven he published his first piece of music&mdash;an American
two step still popular with some Cuban bands. While attending the
National Conservatory in Cuba, from which he was graduated in 1911
with a gold medal in piano playing, he earned his living as a pianist in
caf&eacute;s and movie theaters. In 1917 he paid the first of several visits to the
United States, at that time making some records and giving a piano
recital. He then made concert tours throughout America and Europe
playing the piano and conducting semi-classical and popular orchestras.
His performances were largely responsible for popularizing in America
both the conga and the rumba in the 1920&rsquo;s. He also made some successful
appearances at the Capitol Theater, in New York, where he introduced
his own music, including such outstanding successes as <i>Malague&ntilde;a</i>,
<i>Andaluc&iacute;a</i>, and <i>Siboney</i> (the last originally entitled <i>Canto
Siboney</i>, which became an American popular-song hit in 1929). These
and similar pieces made Lecuona one of the most successful exponents
of Latin-American melodies and dance rhythms in the United States.
Lecuona has written over five hundred songs, forty operettas, and
numerous compositions both for orchestra and for piano solo.</p>
<p>From a piano suite entitled <i>Andaluc&iacute;a</i> come two of Lecuona&rsquo;s best
known instrumental compositions. The first is also called <i>Andaluc&iacute;a</i>, a
haunting South American melody set against a compulsive rhythm. It
was made into an American popular song in 1955.</p>
<p>Another movement from <i>Andaluc&iacute;a</i> is even more familiar: the
<i>Malague&ntilde;a</i>. Since its publication as a piano solo in 1929, <i>Malague&ntilde;a</i>
has sold annually over a hundred thousand copies of sheet music each
year; it has become a favorite of concert pianists; it is also often performed
by salon and pop orchestras everywhere in orchestral transcriptions;
and it has been adapted into a popular song, &ldquo;At the Crossroads.&rdquo;
It is in three sections, the first being in the malague&ntilde;a rhythm dynamically
projected in slowing expanding sonorities; a contrast comes in the
middle part with a poignant Latin-American melody.</p>
<p><i>Andaluc&iacute;a</i>, the single movement and not the suite as a whole, has
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
been given a brilliant orchestral dress by Morton Gould who has also
orchestrated two outstandingly popular Lecuona songs. One is &ldquo;La
Comparasa,&rdquo; a picture of a traditional parade during the Carnival season
in which Negroes and muleteers play their native instruments and
sing their sensual songs. The other is &ldquo;Gitanerias,&rdquo; haunting gypsy
music.</p>
<h2 id="c105"><span class="small">Franz <b id="g_Lehar">Leh&aacute;r</b></span></h2>
<p>Franz Leh&aacute;r was born in Komorn, Hungary, on April 30,
1870. His father, a bandmaster, was his first music teacher. When Franz
was twelve, he entered the Prague Conservatory where he remained six
years specializing in the violin with Bennewitz and theory with Foerster.
His studies were completed in 1888, after which he played the
violin in the orchestra of the Eberfeld Opera. He subsequently became
an assistant bandleader of his father&rsquo;s ensemble and a director of
Austria&rsquo;s foremost Marine bands. In 1896 he realized his first success as
a composer of operettas with <i>Kukuschka</i>, produced in Leipzig. In 1902
he became conductor of the Theater-an-der-Wien, in Vienna, home of
operettas. There, in the same year, he had produced <i>Viennese Women</i>
(<i>Wiener Frauen</i>). The operetta after that was <i>The Gypsy</i> (<i>Der Rastelbinder</i>),
seen in 1902 in one of Vienna&rsquo;s other theaters. With <i>The Merry
Widow</i> (<i>Die lustige Witwe</i>), seen in 1905, Leh&aacute;r achieved a triumph of
such magnitude that from then on he was one of Austria&rsquo;s most celebrated
operetta composers (and one of the wealthiest) since Johann
Strauss II. He wrote about thirty more operettas (three of them in the
single year of 1909-1910). The most famous were <i>The Count of Luxembourg</i>
(<i>Der Graf von Luxemburg</i>) in 1909; <i>Gypsy Love</i> (<i>Zigeunerliebe</i>)
in 1910; <i>Frasquita</i> in 1922; <i>Paganini</i> in 1925; <i>The Tsarevitch</i>
(<i>Der Zarewitsch</i>) in 1927; and <i>The Land of Smiles</i> (<i>Das Land des
Laechelns</i>) in 1929. During World War II Leh&aacute;r lived in seclusion at
his villa in Bad Ischl, Austria. After the war he became embittered by
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
the widely publicized accusation that he had been pro Nazi, arising no
doubt from the well-known fact that <i>The Merry Widow</i> was Hitler&rsquo;s
favorite operetta. What was forgotten in this attack against Leh&aacute;r was
the fact that his wife had been classified by Nazis as non-Aryan and that
on one occasion both and he and his wife were subjected by the Gestapo
to house arrest. Leh&aacute;r died in Bad Ischl, Austria, on October 24, 1948.
He is one of the few composers to outlive the copyrights of some of his
most famous works.</p>
<p>Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s popularity in the early part of this century gave the Viennese
operetta a new lease on life at a time when its heyday was believed
over. It was through the influence of Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s immense popularity and
success that composers like Oscar Straus, Emmerich K&aacute;lm&aacute;n, and Leo
Fall began writing their own operettas. Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s best stage works have
been described as &ldquo;dance operettas&rdquo; because of the emphasis placed on
dance music, the waltz specifically. The dance usually becomes the
climax, the focal point, of the production. Stan Czech further points
out that Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s waltzes are &ldquo;slower and sweeter than those of Johann
Strauss, were definite prototypes of the modern slow waltz, and their
Slav atmosphere gave them an exciting and individual character.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Count of Luxembourg</i> (<i>Der Graf von Luxemburg</i>)&mdash;text by
Willner and Robert Bodanzky&mdash;was first given in Vienna on November
12, 1909. This operetta opens in an artist&rsquo;s studio in Paris where Ren&eacute;,
the impoverished Count of Luxembourg, is offered five hundred thousand
francs by Prince Basil if Ren&eacute; is willing to marry the singer Angele
and let her share his title. The reason for this peculiar arrangement
is that the Prince is himself in love with Angele, wants to marry her,
but prefers that his wife have a title. After they get married, Ren&eacute; and
Angele discover they are in love with each other, a fact which eventually
the Prince is willing to accept since he is ordered by the Czar to
marry a legitimate Countess. As in most Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s operettas, the high
musical moment comes with a waltz&mdash;the infectious duet of Ren&eacute; and
Angele, &ldquo;<i>Bist du&rsquo;s, lachendes Glueck</i>,&rdquo; which is also extremely popular
in orchestral adaptations. Other appealing numbers are the second act
duet, &ldquo;<i>Lieber Freund, man greift nicht</i>&rdquo; and the tenor aria, &ldquo;<i>Maedel
klein, Maedel fein</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Frasquita</i>, produced in Vienna on May 12, 1922, is remembered
most often for one of Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s most beautiful vocal numbers, the nostalgic
and romantic <i>Frasquita Serenade</i>, &ldquo;<i>Hab ein blaues Himmelbett</i>.&rdquo;
Fritz Kreisler made a fine transcription for violin and piano, and Sigmund
Spaeth provided the melody with American lyrics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p><i>Gypsy Love</i> (<i>Zigeunerliebe</i>), had its world premi&egrave;re in Vienna on
January 8, 1910. The librettists (Willner and Bodanzky) provided a
romantic storybook setting of Rumania, and a romantic central character
in the form of the gypsy violinist, Jozsi. Zorika is ineluctably
drawn to Jozsi though she is actually betrothed to his half-brother,
Jonel. In a dream, she gets a foretaste of what her life would be with
one so irresponsible and fickle as a gypsy violinist, with the result that
she is more than happy to marry Jonel. The main waltz melody (one
of Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s greatest) is &ldquo;<i>Nur der Liebe macht uns jung</i>&rdquo; and the most
infectious Hungarian tune is Jozsi&rsquo;s soaring entrance gypsy melody to
the accompaniment of his violin, &ldquo;<i>Ich bin ein Zigeunerkind</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From <i>The Land of Smiles</i> (<i>Das Land des Laechelns</i>) comes what is
probably the best loved and most widely sung of all of Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s vocal
numbers, &ldquo;Dein ist mein ganzes Herz&rdquo; (&ldquo;Thine Is My Heart Alone&rdquo;)
which opened not in Vienna but in Berlin, on October 10, 1929. This
was actually a new version of an old Leh&aacute;r operetta, originally called
<i>The Yellow Jacket</i> (<i>Die gelbe Jacke</i>) which had been introduced in
Vienna in 1923. The romantic plot of both operettas involved a
Chinese diplomat, Prince Sou-Chong, and Lisa, daughter of an Austrian
Count. They marry and settle in Peking in whose strange setting, Lisa&rsquo;s
love for the Prince soon turns to hate. With great magnanimity&mdash;even
though this is in violation of ancient Chinese traditions and customs&mdash;he
allows Lisa to leave him and return home.</p>
<p>In <i>The Yellow Jacket</i>, &ldquo;Thine Is My Heart Alone&rdquo; is sung by Lisa,
and at that time this number made little impression. The famous tenor,
Richard Tauber, fell in love with it, and performed it so extensively
in his recitals everywhere that he and the song became inextricably identified.
When Leh&aacute;r revised his operetta and renamed it <i>The Land of
Smiles</i>, he cast the song &ldquo;Thine Is My Heart Alone&rdquo; as a major second-act
aria for Prince Sou-Chong, Richard Tauber playing the part of the
Prince. <i>The Land of Smiles</i> was a personal triumph for Tauber who
appeared in it over 2,500 times all over the world. &ldquo;Thine Is My Heart
Alone&rdquo; became with him something of a theme song. He rarely gave a
concert anywhere without singing it either on the program itself or as
an encore. When <i>The Land of Smiles</i> was given in New York City in
1946, with Tauber as the star, the operetta was renamed <i>Yours Is My
Heart</i>; in this production Tauber sang the song four times in four different
languages, French, Italian, German, and English.</p>
<p>There can be little question but that <i>The Merry Widow</i> (<i>Die lustige
Witwe</i>) is one of the most famous operettas ever written. It was a sensation
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
when first performed, in Vienna on December 28, 1905. It came
both to London and New York in 1907, a major success in both places.
In Buenos Aires it was performed simultaneously in five theaters in five
different languages. Since 1907 there was hardly a time when <i>The Merry
Widow</i> was not being performed in some part of the world. It has enjoyed
in excess of six thousand performances, a thousand of these in
Vienna alone. On several occasions it has been adapted for the screen.</p>
<p>Victor L&eacute;on and Leo Stein wrote the text. This is the usual operetta
material involving a beautiful heiress from a mythical kingdom. She is
Sonia from Marsovia, who is leading a gay life in Paris. Beautiful and
wealthy, she is inevitably sought out by the most handsome men of
Paris. The government of Marsovia is eager to get her to marry one of
its native sons, the dashing Prince Danilo, thereby keeping her fortune
at home. As she conducts her vivacious night life she is zealously
watched over by the Marsovian Ambassador, Baron Popoff, who never
loses an opportunity to further the interests of Danilo. Eventually,
Sonia has had her fling and is ready to settle down with the Prince.</p>
<p>The <i>Merry Widow Waltz</i>, &ldquo;<i>S&rsquo;fluestern Geigen, Lippen schweigen</i>,&rdquo;
an eye-filling climax to the third act, is not only the most popular excerpt
from this operetta but also one of the most celebrated waltzes
ever written. A secondary waltz, &ldquo;Vilia&rdquo; is also highly beguiling, while
a third musical favorite from this score is &ldquo;<i>Da geh&rsquo; ich zu Maxim</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>The Girl at Maxim&rsquo;s</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>What is one of Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s best waltzes, second in popularity only to that
of <i>The Merry Widow</i>, does not come from any operetta. It is the <i>Gold
and Silver Waltzes</i> (<i>Gold und Silber Waelzer</i>), op. 79 which he wrote as
a concert number.</p>
<h2 id="c106"><span class="small">Ruggiero <b id="g_Leoncavallo">Leoncavallo</b></span></h2>
<p>Ruggiero Leoncavallo was born in Naples, Italy,
on March 8, 1858. He was graduated from the Bologna Conservatory,
then spent several years traveling. He finally came to Paris where he
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
earned his living playing the piano, singing, and writing music-hall
songs. The powerful Italian publisher, Ricordi, commissioned him to
write a trilogy of operas set in the Renaissance. Leoncavallo completed
the first of these operas, <i>I Medici</i>, but it proved too expensive to mount
and was shelved. This experience convinced him that he ought to write
an opera of slighter dimensions, one which would not cost too much to
produce, and which would be in the realistic style (&ldquo;<i>Verismo</i>&rdquo;) just
made so popular by Mascagni&rsquo;s <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>. In four months&rsquo;
time, Leoncavallo completed <i>Pagliacci</i>, the opera through which his
name survives. It received a triumphant premi&egrave;re in Milan in 1892,
with Toscanini conducting. Though Leoncavallo wrote many operas
after that he never wrote one as good or as popular as the one that made
him world famous. Only one of these later operas has retained interest,
<i>Zaza</i>, introduced in 1900. A third opera, <i>La Boh&egrave;me</i>, was well received
when introduced in Venice in 1897, but was soon thrown into complete
obscurity by a rival opera on the same subject, that of Puccini. In
1906 Leoncavallo toured the United States in performances of <i>Pagliacci</i>.
The failures of his last operas made him a bitter, broken man in
the last years of his life. He died in Montecatini, Italy, on August 9,
1919.</p>
<p>The composer prepared his own libretto for <i>Pagliacci</i>, a play within
a play. A troupe of strolling players headed by Canio arrives for performances
in a Calabrian village. Canio&rsquo;s wife, Nedda, falls in love with
Silvio, one of the villagers, and she in turn is being pursued by the
pathetic clown of the troupe, Tonio. Through Tonio, Canio discovers
his wife has been unfaithful to him, but fails to learn the identity of
his rival. At the troupe&rsquo;s evening performance&mdash;and in a play that
closely resembles the actual happenings within the company&mdash;Canio
kills Nedda when she fails to tell him who her lover is. But Silvio, in the
audience, reveals himself by rushing on the stage to help Nedda. There
Canio kills him.</p>
<p>Many of the selections from this opera are famous, but the most
famous of all is the tenor aria, in which Canio speaks his immense grief
on discovering that his wife has a lover, &ldquo;<i>Vesti la giubba</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other familiar excerpts include the baritone prologue, &ldquo;<i>Si pu&ograve;</i>,&rdquo;
in which Tonio explains to his audience that the incidents in the play
about to be presented are true to life and that the players are not performers
but human beings; Nedda&rsquo;s delightful ballatella, &ldquo;The Bird
Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Stridono lass&ugrave;</i>&rdquo;) where she tries to forget about Tonio&rsquo;s initial
response of jealousy by watching and describing the casual and carefree
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
flight of birds overhead; the &ldquo;Harlequin&rsquo;s Serenade&rdquo; in the play within
the play sequence in the second act, &ldquo;<i>O Columbina!</i>&rdquo;; and a melodious
orchestral Intermezzo which separates the first and second acts, music
which hints darkly at impending tragedy through a poignant recall of
Tonio&rsquo;s prologue.</p>
<h2 id="c107"><span class="small">Anatol <b id="g_Liadov">Liadov</b></span></h2>
<p>Anatol Liadov was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on
May 10, 1855, the son and grandson of eminent Russian conductors. He
was a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, but
was so derelict about attending classes that in 1876 he was expelled.
Reinstated two years later he now became fired with both ambition and
industry, proved a brilliant student, and was graduated with highest
honors. He was then appointed teacher of theory there, eventually becoming
a renowned professor, a post he retained until the end of his
life. He died in Novgorod, Russia, on August 28, 1914.</p>
<p>Liadov was at his best in his fairy tales for orchestra (<i>The Enchanted
Lake</i>, <i>Baba Yaga</i> and <i>Kikimora</i>); in songs; and in smaller pieces for the
piano. He was a student of Russian folk music of which he made numerous
adaptations, and whose styles and idioms percolated into many of
his compositions.</p>
<p>The <i>Eight Russian Folksongs</i>, a suite for orchestra, op. 58 (1906) is
one of Liadov&rsquo;s adaptations. There are eight movements. In the first,
&ldquo;Religious Chant,&rdquo; the main song is that chanted by children in religious
processions; it is heard in English horn and bassoons. This is followed
by &ldquo;Christmas Carol,&rdquo; its main theme presented by oboes and
clarinets. &ldquo;Plaintive Melody&rdquo; is a village song, and &ldquo;I Danced With a
Mosquito,&rdquo; a humorous scherzo in which muted strings simulated buzzing
mosquitoes. The fifth movement is &ldquo;Legend of the Birds&rdquo; where the
bird song is presented by the woodwind. &ldquo;Cradle Song&rdquo; is a tender
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
melody for strings. This is followed by a lively rhythmic section,
&ldquo;Round Dance.&rdquo; The suite ends with the &ldquo;Village Dance Song,&rdquo; music
that usually accompanies the crowning of the May Queen.</p>
<p>Liadov is also the composer of a delightful trifle called <i>The Music
Box</i> in which the delicate little tune is the kind that lends itself gratefully
to the tinkle of a music box. Liadov wrote this piece for the piano,
op. 32, but it is better known in orchestral transcriptions.</p>
<h2 id="c108"><span class="small">Paul <b id="g_Lincke">Lincke</b></span></h2>
<p>Paul Lincke was born in Berlin, Germany, on November 7,
1866. After completing his music study he played the violin and bassoon
in numerous theater orchestras. He later distinguished himself
as a theater conductor. In 1897 he had his first operetta produced in
Berlin. Thereafter he wrote many operettas, all originally given in
Berlin; he became one of the foremost exponents of the light musical
theater in Germany of his time. The most famous were <i>Frau Luna</i>
(1899), <i>Fraeulein Loreley</i> (1900), <i>Lysistrata</i> (1902), <i>Prinzessin Rosine</i>
(1905), and <i>Casanova</i> (1914). His last operetta was <i>Ein Liebestraum</i>,
produced in Hamburg in 1940. From 1918 to 1920 he was conductor
at the Folies-Berg&egrave;re in Paris. He died in Klausthal-Zellernfeld, Germany,
on September 3, 1946.</p>
<p>His most famous composition is a song from <i>Lysistrata</i> (1902): &ldquo;The
Glow Worm&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Gluehwuermchen</i>&rdquo;), which achieved phenomenal popularity
throughout the world independent of the operetta. It is still
famous both as a vocal composition and in orchestral transcriptions.
A new vocal version, with amusing lyrics by Johnny Mercer, was published
and popularized in the United States in 1952.</p>

<h2 id="c109"><span class="small">Franz <b id="g_Liszt">Liszt</b></span></h2>
<p>Franz Liszt was born in Raiding, Hungary, on October 22,
1811. A prodigy pianist who made an impressive debut in Hungary
when he was nine, Liszt was financed by several Hungarian noblemen
to study the piano with Czerny in Vienna. In 1822, Liszt made a sensational
debut in that city, and in 1824, after a period of additional study
in Paris, an equally momentous appearance in the French capital. For
the next three years Liszt concertized throughout Europe, becoming an
idol of music audiences everywhere. Then, in 1827, he decided to
abandon music for what he regarded as nobler pursuits. He devoted
himself in turn to religion, politics, literature, and philosophy without
finding the satisfaction he sought. Then, in 1830, he went back to
music. For about two years he worked industriously on his piano technique,
reassuming an imperial position among the virtuosos of his generation
beginning with 1833. He combined profound musicianship and
a phenomenal technique with such a flair for showmanship and self-aggrandizement,
that it can be said that the modern piano virtuoso
(both in the best and worst sense of that term) was born with him.</p>
<p>In 1848, Liszt came to Weimar to fulfill duties as Kapellmeister to
the Grand Duke. The eleven-year period of this office represented
music-making of the highest order, as Liszt devoted himself to presenting
the foremost operatic and symphonic music in the best possible
performances. He was indefatigable in propagandizing the music of
the avant-garde composers of his day, reviving Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Tannhaeuser</i>
and presenting the world premi&egrave;re of that master&rsquo;s <i>Lohengrin</i> at a time
when Wagner was in disrepute in Germany because of his revolutionary
activities.</p>
<p>Finding himself incapable of maintaining the high standards he had
set, and disturbed by the prevailing antagonism to his espousal of new
music, Liszt left Weimar in 1859. Once again he sought refuge in a
career outside music. In 1865 he submitted to the tonsure and entered
the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi as abb&eacute;. But music was not
abandoned. He taught the piano to gifted pupils who came to him from
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
all parts of the world; and he wrote an abundant amount of music,
mainly for the piano. He died in Bayreuth, Bavaria, on July 31, 1886,
still at the height of his powers and fame as composer, pianist and
teacher.</p>
<p>Liszt left a vast repertory of music, including tone poems, symphonies,
piano concertos, songs, and a library of works for the piano. At
his best he was a great innovator, and a creator of vast dramatic and
poetic concepts. At worst, he was a showman shamelessly wooing his
public with superficial effects and trivial material. Most of his works
belong to the concert hall, but some of it has enormous popular appeal
as salon music.</p>
<p>The most famous of the latter is the <i>Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2</i> in
C-sharp minor (1847), originally for piano solo but subsequently orchestrated
by the composer himself. This was one of nineteen compositions
in which Liszt developed the form of the rhapsody and helped to
make it popular; which he filled with strong national feelings and the
individual traits of Hungarian folk music. One of the features of all
these rhapsodies is their dynamic alternation of slow and sensual music
(called <i>lassan</i>) with fast, dramatic, exciting passages (called <i>friskan</i>).
The second <i>Hungarian Rhapsody</i> opens with a <i>lassan</i>, a slow, stately
declamation. Then, after a clarinet cadenza, the <i>friskan</i> appears, a
spirited melody for violins and woodwind. After that fast and slow passages,
soft and loud dynamics, and rapidly changing meters and rhythm
help to generate excitement and create drama. The drama and the excitement
of this music never seem to lose their impact however many
times this rhapsody is listened to.</p>
<p>Of Liszt&rsquo;s twelve tone poems for orchestra the most famous is <i>Les
Pr&eacute;ludes</i> (1850). The tone poem, or symphonic poem, is Liszt&rsquo;s creation
in an attempt to bring to orchestral music the pictorial, dramatic
and programmatic qualities of Wagner&rsquo;s music dramas. Thus Liszt
conceived a one-movement composition, flexible in form, in which
a story is told, picture described, or poem interpreted. The inspiration
for <i>Les Pr&eacute;ludes</i> is the <i>M&eacute;ditations po&eacute;tiques</i> of Lamartine, from
which several lines are quoted in the published score to provide the
music with its program:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is life but a series of Preludes to that unknown song of which
death strikes the first solemn note? Love is the magic dawn of every
existence; but where is the life in which the first enjoyment of bliss is
not dispelled by some tempest; its illusions scattered by some fatal
breath; its altar consumed as by a thunderbolt? What soul, this cruelly
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
hurt, but seeks to repose with its memories in the sweet calm of pastoral
life? Yet no man is content to resign himself for long to the mild, beneficent
charms of Nature, and when the trumpet gives the alarm he
hastens to the post of danger, on whatever field he may be called to
fight, so that once more he may find in action full consciousness of
himself and the possession of all his powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Les Pr&eacute;ludes</i> opens with a dignified subject in the basses which is
subjected to considerable change and amplification before the main
melody is introduced. This melody is an elegiac song expressing the
happiness of love; its first entrance comes in four horns, strings, and
harp. The music is carried to a climactic point, after which a frenetic
mood is projected. Plaintively the oboe recalls the main melody; a
country dance tune is offered by the horn; and the main melody reappears
with opulent treatment. Another section of storm and stress
follows before the final majestic statement of the main melody.</p>
<p>Of Liszt&rsquo;s voluminous writings for the piano, one composition above
all others has won favor throughout the music world as a tender, and
sentimental expression of love. It is the <i>Liebestraum</i>, &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo;
Liszt actually wrote three <i>Liebestr&auml;ume</i>, but it is the third of this set&mdash;in
A-flat major (1850)&mdash;which is considered when we speak or hear of
the <i>Liebestraum</i>. All of these three piano compositions are adaptations
of songs by the same composer; the third <i>Liebestraum</i> originated as
&ldquo;<i>O Lieb&rsquo;, so lang du lieben kannst</i>,&rdquo; words by Freiligrath.</p>
<h2 id="c110"><span class="small">Frederick <b id="g_Loewe">Loewe</b></span></h2>
<p>Frederick Loewe was born in Vienna, Austria, on June
10, 1904. A musical prodigy, he began to study the piano when he was
five; started composition at seven; at thirteen made a successful appearance
as pianist with the Berlin Symphony; and at fifteen was the composer
of a hit song, &ldquo;Katrina,&rdquo; that sold over a million copies of sheet
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
music in Europe. He received a thorough musical training from Busoni,
Eug&egrave;ne d&rsquo;Albert, and Emil Nikolaus Rezniček, winning the Hollander
Medal for piano playing in 1923. One year after that he came to the
United States. Unable to make any progress in his musical career, he
spent the next decade traveling around the country and filling all sorts
of odd jobs. He punched cattle, mined gold, served as a riding instructor,
and even boxed professionally. Eventually he came back to New
York where he found a job in a Greenwich Village caf&eacute; playing the
piano. In 1938 four of his songs were heard in a Broadway musical,
<i>Great Lady</i>, a failure. A meeting with Alan Jay Lerner, a young lyricist
and librettist, brought him a gifted collaborator. They wrote a musical
comedy that was produced by a stock company in Detroit, and another
called <i>What&rsquo;s Up</i> that was seen on Broadway. Their first major success
came with the Broadway musical, <i>Brigadoon</i>, in 1947. <i>My Fair Lady</i>, in
1956, was one of the greatest successes of the Broadway theater. They
also helped make entertainment history further by writing songs for the
motion picture musical, <i>Gigi</i>, the first to win nine Academy Awards,
including one for Lerner and Loewe for the title song. In 1960, Lerner
and Loewe wrote the Broadway musical <i>Camelot</i> based on King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table.</p>
<p><i>Brigadoon</i> was a whimsical Scottish fantasy which came to Broadway
on March 13, 1947, book and lyrics by Lerner. Brigadoon is a mythical
town in Scotland which comes to life for a single day once every hundred
years. Two American tourists happen to come to Brigadoon during
its one day of existence. They become a part of its quaint life, and
one of them falls in love with a Scottish lass. The musical highlights
include a song that became a hit in 1947, &ldquo;Almost Like Being In Love,&rdquo;
and several that have a charming Scottish flavor, including &ldquo;Come to
Me, Bend to Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Heather on the Hill,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Come Home
With Bonnie Jean.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>My Fair Lady</i>, produced on March 15, 1956, was Lerner&rsquo;s adaptation
for the popular musical theater of Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s <i>Pygmalion</i>. Eliza
Doolittle, an ignorant flower girl and daughter of a cockney, is transformed
by the phonetician, Professor Henry Higgins, into a cultivated
lady who is successfully palmed off upon high English society as a
duchess. Higgins falls in love with her and, though a long confirmed
bachelor, finds he can no longer live without her. <i>My Fair Lady</i> became
one of the most highly acclaimed musical productions of recent
memory; Brooks Atkinson called it &ldquo;one of the best musicals of the
century.&rdquo; It achieved a fabulous Broadway run and was brought by
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
many touring countries to all parts of the civilized world, including the
Soviet Union. It captured one third of the honors annually conferred
on the theater by the Antoinette Perry Awards. The original-cast recording
sold over three million discs. The principal numbers from
Loewe&rsquo;s captivating score include three romantic songs, two of the Hit
Parade variety (&ldquo;I Could Have Danced All Night&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the Street
Where You Live&rdquo;) and the third, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Grown Accustomed to Her
Face&rdquo;; two atmospheric numbers that evoke musically the place and
setting of the play, &ldquo;The Ascot Gavotte&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Embassy Waltz&rdquo;;
and the two cockney ditties of Eliza&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;Get Me to the Church On
Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;With a Little Bit of Luck.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c111"><span class="small">Albert <b id="g_Lortzing">Lortzing</b></span></h2>
<p>Gustav Albert Lortzing was born in Berlin on
October 23, 1801. His parents were actors compelled to lead an itinerant
life which made it impossible for Albert to obtain any systematic
education. His mother taught him music, the study of which he later
continued briefly in Berlin with Rungenhagen. His first effort at composition
consisted of some songs, but in 1824 he completed his first
opera, <i>Ali Pascha von Janina</i>. From 1833 to 1844 he was employed as
a tenor at the Municipal Theater in Leipzig, for which he wrote the
comic opera <i>Die beiden Schuetzen</i>, successfully produced in 1837. He
achieved his greatest success the same year with the comic opera, <i>Zar
und Zimmermann</i>, which within a few years&rsquo; time became a favorite
among theater audiences throughout Europe. His later operettas included
<i>Der Wildschuetz</i> (<i>The Poacher</i>) in 1842 and <i>Der Waffenschmied</i>
(<i>The Armourer</i>) in 1846, while one of his finest romantic operas was
<i>Undine</i> in 1845. Lortzing also filled several engagements as conductor
of operas and operettas in Leipzig, Vienna and Berlin, and as an opera
impresario. He died in Berlin on January 21, 1851, one day after his
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
last opera, <i>Die Opernprobe</i> (<i>The Opera Rehearsal</i>) was introduced in
Frankfort.</p>
<p>Lortzing was one of the earliest and most successful exponents of
German national comic opera; and <i>Czar and the Carpenter</i> (<i>Zar und
Zimmermann</i>) was his masterwork. It was first produced in Leipzig on
December 22, 1837. The music is consistently light and tuneful, frequently
in the style of German folk songs. The libretto, by the composer,
is a delightful comedy based on an actual historic episode: the escapade
of Peter the Great of Russia in Holland where he worked as a carpenter.
In the Lortzing comic opera, Peter the Great is a carpenter on a ship at
Saardam where he meets a compatriot, also named Peter, who is a deserter.
Temporarily they become rivals for the affection of Mary. After
the arrival of the Ambassadors from France and England to seek out the
Emperor, the latter quietly departs for his homeland, leaving behind
him both money and an official pardon for the other Peter. The gay
spirit of the comic opera as a whole is magically caught not only in its
vivacious overture, but in several familiar excerpts. The most notable
are: the Burgomaster&rsquo;s comic entrance song, &ldquo;<i>O sancta justa</i>&rdquo;; in the second
act, the Wedding Chorus, and the French Ambassador&rsquo;s beautiful
air, &ldquo;<i>Lebe wohl, mein flandrisch&rsquo; Maedchen</i>&rdquo;; in the third act the vigorous
<i>Clog Dance</i> (<i>Holzschutanz</i>), and the very famous air of Czar Peter,
&ldquo;<i>Sonst spielt&rsquo; ich mit Zepter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c112"><span class="small">Alexandre <b id="g_Luigini">Luigini</b></span></h2>
<p>Alexandre Luigini was born in Lyons, France, on
March 9, 1850. He was the son of the distinguished conductor of the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Italien in Paris. After attending the Paris Conservatory&mdash;where
he was a pupil of Massenet and Massart among others&mdash;the younger
Luigini played the violin in his father&rsquo;s orchestra. In 1870 he began a
successful career as ballet composer with <i>Le R&ecirc;ve de Nicette</i>, given in
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
Lyons. His greatest success came with the <i>Ballet &Eacute;gyptien</i>, first seen in
Lyons in 1875. For twenty years Luigini was the conductor of the Grand
Theater in Lyons and professor of harmony at the Lyons Conservatory.
Until the end of his life he was the conductor of the Op&eacute;ra-Comique in
Paris. He died in Paris on July 29, 1906.</p>
<p>An orchestral suite derived from some of the most attractive pages of
the <i>Ballet &Eacute;gyptien</i> score is a favorite of bands and salon orchestras
everywhere. This is music striking for its Oriental-type melodies and
harmonies, and for its colorful orchestral hues. The first two movements
are particularly popular. The first begins with a strong and
stately theme, but midway comes a gayer section in an exotic Oriental
style. The second movement highlights a capricious subject for the
woodwind, once again in a recognizable Oriental style.</p>
<h2 id="c113"><span class="small">Hans Christian <b id="g_Lumbye">Lumbye</b></span></h2>
<p>Hans Christian Lumbye was born in Copenhagen,
Denmark on May 2, 1810. As a young man he played in military bands.
He then formed an orchestra of his own which achieved extraordinary
fame throughout Copenhagen (specifically at the Tivoli) with light
musical programs. For these concerts Lumbye produced a library of
light music: waltzes, galops, polkas, marches, and so forth. This music
is so filled with infectious tunes and pulsating rhythms&mdash;and they are so
light in heart and spirit&mdash;that they have won for their composer the
sobriquet of &ldquo;The Johann Strauss of the North&rdquo; and the status of Denmark&rsquo;s
foremost creator of semi-classical music. He died in Copenhagen
on March 20, 1874.</p>
<p>Lumbye&rsquo;s dance pieces are played wherever there is a salon, pop or
caf&eacute;-house orchestra. Among his best waltzes are <i>Amelie</i>, <i>Hesperus</i>, and
<i>Sophie</i>. Other successful Lumbye compositions are the <i>Columbine
Mazurka</i>, the <i>Champagne Galop</i>, <i>Concert Polka</i>, <i>Dream Pictures</i>, <i>An</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
<i>Evening at the Tivoli</i>, <i>King Frederick VII Homage March</i>, and the
<i>Railway Galop</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c114"><span class="small">Edward <b id="g_Macdowell">MacDowell</b></span></h2>
<p>Edward Alexander Macdowell, one of
America&rsquo;s most significant 19th-century composers, was born in New
York City on December 18, 1861. After preliminary music study with
private teachers, he attended the Paris Conservatory from 1876 to 1878,
and the Frankfort Conservatory in Germany from 1879 to 1881. Maintaining
his home in Germany, MacDowell joined the faculty of the
Darmstadt Conservatory in 1881, and in 1882 he made an official bow
as a composer by introducing his first piano concerto in Zurich, and his
<i>Modern Suite</i> for piano in Germany. He returned to the United States
in 1888, settling in Boston where a year later the Boston Symphony
under Gericke introduced his now-famous Second Piano Concerto, the
composer appearing as soloist. From then on, most of his important
symphonic works were introduced by the Boston Symphony, placing
him in the vanguard of American composers of that period. In 1896
he filled the first chair of music created at Columbia University in New
York; at that time he was described as &ldquo;the greatest musical genius
America has produced.&rdquo; MacDowell resigned in 1904 after sharp differences
with the trustees of the University over the way a music department
should be run. The bitterness and frustrations suffered by MacDowell
during this altercation with the University undermined and
finally broke his always delicate health. His brain tissues became
affected. From 1905 on he was a victim of insanity, spending his time
in an innocent, childlike state, until his death in New York City on
January 23, 1908. Shortly after his death the MacDowell Memorial
Association was founded to establish a retreat for American creative
artists on MacDowell&rsquo;s summer residence in Peterborough, New Hampshire,
which MacDowell&rsquo;s widow had deeded to the Association.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>A composer whose artistic roots lay deep in the soil of German
Romanticism, MacDowell was a composer who filled his writing with
noble poetic sentiments and the most sensitive emotions. His sense of
style and his feeling for structure were the last words in elegance, and
his lyricism and harmonic language were ever ingratiatingly inviting to
the ear.</p>
<p>The <i>Indian Suite</i>, op. 48 (1892) is the second of MacDowell&rsquo;s suites
for orchestra. It is one of several works in which MacDowell uses
melodic and rhythmic material of the American Indian, blending this
idiom with his usual sensitive and poetic style. This is one of MacDowell&rsquo;s
most popular works for orchestra. The first movement, &ldquo;Legend,&rdquo;
has a slow introduction in which the main melody is given by
three unaccompanied horns in unison. The melody is taken over by
other instruments and developed. Here the material comes from a
sacred ceremony of Iroquois Indians. The second movement is &ldquo;Love
Song,&rdquo; whose principal subject is immediately given by the woodwind;
this melody is derived from the music of Iowa Indians. &ldquo;War Time&rdquo;
follows, a movement dominated by a melody to which Indians of the
Atlantic Coast ascribed supernatural origin. This melody is heard in the
first sixteen measures in two unison unaccompanied flutes. A subsidiary
section follows. &ldquo;Dirge,&rdquo; the fourth movement, is a woman&rsquo;s
song of mourning for an absent son, come from the Kiowa Indians.
The mournful melody is heard in muted violins. The suite ends with
&ldquo;Village Festival,&rdquo; in which two light and vivacious melodies from the
Iroquois Indians are presented; the first is a woman&rsquo;s dance, and the
second a war song.</p>
<p>The most familiar pieces of music written by MacDowell&mdash;<i>To a
Water Lily</i> and <i>To a Wild Rose</i>&mdash;come from the <i>Woodland Sketches</i>,
op. 51 (1896), a suite for solo piano made up of ten sections, each a descriptive
poem in tones. In this suite MacDowell became one of the
first American composers to interpret the beauty of American scenes
and countrysides in delicate melodies. Both <i>To a Water Lily</i> and <i>To a
Wild Rose</i> are exquisite tone pictures of Nature, and both have enjoyed
numerous transcriptions. The other eight movements of the
<i>Woodland Sketches</i> are: <i>Will o&rsquo; the Wisp</i>, <i>At an Old Trysting Place</i>,
<i>In Autumn</i>, <i>From an Old Indian Lodge</i>, <i>From Uncle Remus</i>, <i>A Deserted
Farm</i>, <i>By a Meadow Brook</i>, and <i>Told at Sunset</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c115"><span class="small">Albert Hay <b id="g_Malotte">Malotte</b></span></h2>
<p>Albert Hay Malotte was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
on May 19, 1895. The son of a choirmaster, he himself was a
boy chorister, at the St. James Episcopal Church in his native city. After
his music studies were completed in Paris and London, he served as
organist in Chicago and London. In 1927 he opened a school for organists
in Los Angeles, but when sound came to the screen he gave up the
school to write music for the films. He subsequently joined the music
staff at the Walt Disney studio, creating music for several of Disney&rsquo;s
animated cartoons, including <i>Ferdinand the Bull</i>. He has written ballets,
choral music, and songs, besides scores for motion pictures, having
received early in his career as composer important advice, guidance
and encouragement from Victor Herbert.</p>
<p>Malotte is most famous for his song, &ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer,&rdquo; published
in 1935, and since become a favorite of concert singers everywhere. Its
deep religious sentiment, and the exciting dramatic thrust of its concluding
measures, have an inescapable impact on audiences.</p>
<h2 id="c116"><span class="small">Gabriel <b id="g_Marie">Marie</b></span></h2>
<p>Gabriel Marie was born in Paris, France, on January 8,
1852. After completing his music study at the Paris Conservatory he
served for six years as chorusmaster of the Lamoureux Orchestra. Between
1887 and 1894 he conducted the concerts of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
de musique. He later led the orchestral performances in Bordeaux and
Marseilles, and during the summers at the Vichy Casino. He was traveling
in Spain when he died there suddenly on August 29, 1928.</p>
<p>Marie was a successful composer of light music for orchestra. The one
composition which has survived is <i>La Cinquantaine</i>, a sentimental
piece for orchestra which is also famous in adaptations for violin and
piano, or cello and piano. Marie described this work as an &ldquo;air in the
old style.&rdquo; It is in three-part song form. The first and third parts consist
of a light, delicate little air; the middle section is in a slower and
statelier style.</p>
<h2 id="c117"><span class="small"><b id="g_Martini">Martini</b> il Tedesco</span></h2>
<p>Jean Paul &Eacute;gide Martini&mdash;sometimes called
&ldquo;Il Tedesco&rdquo; or &ldquo;The German&rdquo; to distinguish him from Padre Martini
the famous 18th century Italian composer and theorist&mdash;was born in
Freistadt, in the Palatinate, on September 1, 1741. His real name is
Schwarzendorf. After completing the study of the organ and serving for
a while as church organist, he won a prize for a military march for the
Swiss Guard. For many years he was an officer of a Hussar regiment.
During this military service he completed an opera, <i>L&rsquo;Amoureux de
quinze ans</i> (successfully introduced in Paris in 1771) and a considerable
amount of band music. After leaving the army, he served as music
director for the Prince of Cond&eacute; and the Comte d&rsquo;Artois; as conductor
at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Feydeau in Paris; and as Inspector and teacher of composition
at the Paris Conservatory. He died in Paris on February 10,
1816.</p>
<p>The composer of twelve operas, some church music and many songs,
Martini is today remembered for a single song&mdash;the eloquent and tender
love melody, &ldquo;<i>Plaisir d&rsquo;amour</i>,&rdquo; written originally for voice and harp,
and arranged by Berlioz for voice and orchestra. Since Berlioz&rsquo; time it
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
has enjoyed numerous instrumental adaptations. Effective use of the
song, as recurring theme music, was made in the American motion picture
starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, <i>Love Affair</i> (1939).</p>
<h2 id="c118"><span class="small">Pietro <b id="g_Mascagni">Mascagni</b></span></h2>
<p>Pietro Mascagni was born in Leghorn, Italy, on December
7, 1863. He studied music with private teachers in Leghorn, then
for several years attended the Milan Conservatory. In 1884 he was
appointed conductor of the municipal band in Cerignola. Meanwhile in
1880 he had completed his first opera, <i>Pinotta</i>. Success as composer came
later in 1890 with the world premi&egrave;re of the opera, <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>
in Rome. A sensation when first introduced, <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> made
the rounds of the world capitals to enjoy a triumph experienced by
few operas before or since. Mascagni wrote many operas after that.
Though he enjoyed varying degrees of success with <i>L&rsquo;Amico Fritz</i> in
1891 and <i>Iris</i> in 1898, he never again duplicated the acclaim given
<i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>; and it is still the only one of his operas performed
in the world&rsquo;s foremost opera houses. As he himself once said sadly: &ldquo;It
is a pity I wrote <i>Cavalleria</i> first. I was crowned before I became king.&rdquo;
Mascagni made many tours as a conductor. He visited the United States
in 1902 in performances of several of his operas, and South America in
1911. In 1929 he succeeded Toscanini as musical director of La Scala in
Milan. Identifying himself closely with the Fascist regime&mdash;even to the
point of writing an opera, <i>Nerone</i>, glorifying Mussolini&mdash;Mascagni was
subjected to considerable abuse and attack after World War II. He
was deprived of his property and other assets. The last year of his life
was lived in poverty and disrepute in a small hotel room in Rome,
where he died on August 2, 1945.</p>
<p><i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> is a one-act opera, libretto by Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti
and Guido Menasci based on a short story by Giovanni
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
Verga. The setting is Sicily in the latter part of the 19th century.
Turiddu, a soldier, is in love with Lola, wife of Alfio, a teamster. But
he has also conducted an illicit affair with Santuzza. When Turiddu
rudely rejects Santuzza, she finds revenge by revealing to Alfio the love
intrigue existing between Lola and Turiddu. In the duel that follows
Alfio kills Turiddu.</p>
<p>The most celebrated single excerpt from the opera is the melodious
Intermezzo for orchestra which accompanies the departing townspeople
as they leave church after the Easter services. This music is radiant
with the holiness and serenity of the Easter holiday.</p>
<p>Other popular excerpts include the lovely Siciliana, &ldquo;<i>O Lola bianca</i>,&rdquo;
a tenor aria which is sung offstage and breaks into the middle of the
opening orchestral prelude; this is a serenade by Turiddu to Lola, sung
to harp accompaniment. Santuzza&rsquo;s passionate aria, &ldquo;<i>Voi lo sapete</i>&rdquo; is
the one in which she first discloses to Alfio that his wife and Turiddu
are lovers. Turiddu&rsquo;s deeply emotional aria, &ldquo;<i>Addio alla madre</i>&rdquo; is his
poignant farewell to his mother just before he engages in the duel in
which he meets his doom.</p>
<h2 id="c119"><span class="small">Jules <b id="g_Massenet">Massenet</b></span></h2>
<p>Jules Massenet was born in Montaud in the Loire region
of France on May 12, 1842. He entered the Paris Conservatory when
he was nine, subsequently winning prizes in fugue and piano playing
and, in 1863, the Prix de Rome. Four years later his first opera, <i>La
Grand&rsquo; Tante</i>, was produced in Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War
he was a member of the National Guard. After the war, he achieved
recognition as a composer with his incidental music to <i>Les &Eacute;rynnies</i>, an
oratorio <i>Marie Magdaleine</i>, and an opera <i>Le Roi de Lahore</i>. In 1878
he was elected to the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, the youngest man ever
to receive this honor, and was appointed professor of composition at
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
the Paris Conservatory. He held the latter post until his death with outstanding
distinction. His most significant operas appeared between
1880 and 1900, and included <i>H&eacute;rodiade</i> (1881), <i>Manon</i> (1884), <i>Le Cid</i>
(1885), <i>Werther</i> (1892), <i>Tha&iuml;s</i> (1894) and <i>Sapho</i> (1897). He died in
Paris on August 13, 1912.</p>
<p>A style that had lyrical charm, tender feelings, and poetic content
placed Massenet with the foremost French composers for the lyric
theater. The same qualities are found to a large degree in his instrumental
compositions, and endow them with their immense audience
appeal. He had a vein of tenderness that was his uniquely, often contrasting
this with striking passion and intensity. A master of many different
moods and emotions, he was able to convey them in music that
is suave and polished in the best French tradition.</p>
<p><i>Alsatian Scenes</i> (<i>Sc&egrave;nes alsaciennes</i>) is one of Massenet&rsquo;s most popular
orchestral compositions. It is the seventh of his suites for orchestra and
was written in 1881. For each of its four movements the composer provided
an explicit program. About the first movement, &ldquo;Sunday Morning&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>Dimanche matin</i>&rdquo;) the composer writes: &ldquo;I recall with particular
delight the Alsatian village Sunday morning at the hour of divine service;
the streets deserted, the houses empty except for the elderly ones
who sun themselves before their doors. The church is full, and the
sacred hymns are heard at intervals in passing.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Tavern&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Au
cabaret</i>&rdquo;) is described as the happy meeting place of his friends &ldquo;with
its little windows framed with lead, garlanded with hops and roses....
&lsquo;Ho, Schmidt, some wine!&rsquo; And the songs of the forest rangers
going to shooting matches. Oh, the joyous life and the gay companions!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Under the Linden Trees&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Sous les tilleuls</i>&rdquo;) depicts pictorially &ldquo;the
edge of the fields on a Sunday afternoon, the long avenue of linden
trees, in the shadow of which, hand in hand, quietly talks a pair of
lovers.&rdquo; The suite ends with &ldquo;Sunday Evening&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Dimanche soir: Air
alsacien, Retraite fran&ccedil;aise</i>&rdquo;). &ldquo;In the market place, what noise, what
movement! Everyone at the doorsteps, groups of young gallants in the
streets, and dances which embody in rhythm the songs of the country.
Eight o&rsquo;clock! The noise of the drums, the blare of the trumpets&mdash;&rsquo;tis
the retreat! The French retreat! And when in the distance the sound of
the drum died down, the women called their children in the street, the
old men relighted their big old pipes, and to the sounds of violins the
dance is joyously recommenced in smaller circles, with couples closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ballet music for <i>Le Cid</i> is strikingly appealing for its exotic
melodies and lambent orchestral colors. This opera, text by Louis Gallet
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
and Edouard Blau, is based on Corneille&rsquo;s tragedy; its premi&egrave;re performance
took place in Paris on November 30, 1885. The setting is
12th century Burgos, in Spain, where Rodrigo called Le Cid, or The
Conqueror, kills Chim&egrave;ne&rsquo;s father in a duel. She seeks vengeance but
is unable to carry it out because she has fallen in love with him. The
ballet music appears in the second scene of the second act. A public
square is alive and colorful with dancing crowds, and six dances are
performed in rapid succession, some with melodic and rhythmic material
derived by Massenet from Spanish folk sources. These are the
dances: &ldquo;<i>Castillane</i>,&rdquo; a highly rhythmic dance found in the Castille region
of Spain; &ldquo;<i>Andalouse</i>,&rdquo; a sinuous, gypsy-like dance from Andalusia;
&ldquo;<i>Aragonaise</i>,&rdquo; a dance popular in the Aragon district; &ldquo;<i>Aubade</i>,&rdquo;
a gentle lyrical section; &ldquo;<i>Catalane</i>,&rdquo; a dance popular in Catalonia;
&ldquo;<i>Madril&egrave;ne</i>,&rdquo; a two-part dance from Madrid, the first quiet and introspective,
the second dynamic; and &ldquo;<i>Navarraise</i>,&rdquo; a dance from Navarre.</p>
<p>The popular &ldquo;<i>&Eacute;l&eacute;gie</i>,&rdquo; a plangent melody muted in its grief, comes
from the incidental music to <i>Les &Eacute;rynnies</i> with which Massenet first
won acclaim in 1873. The play, by Charles Marie Leconte based on
Aeschylus, was produced with Massenet&rsquo;s music at the Od&eacute;on in Paris.
Here the &ldquo;<i>&Eacute;l&eacute;gie</i>&rdquo; appeared as &ldquo;<i>Invocation</i>,&rdquo; scored for string orchestra.
Later on Massenet arranged this section for cello and piano, and it was
upon this occasion that he renamed the piece <i>&Eacute;l&eacute;gie</i>. It was later on also
transcribed for violin and piano, and adapted into a song with lyrics by
E. Gallet.</p>
<p>Three other sections from <i>Les &Eacute;rynnies</i> have almost as much emotional
appeal as the <i>&Eacute;l&eacute;gie</i>, but in varied moods. The &ldquo;Entr&rsquo;acte&rdquo; is a
passionate song for unison violins over a disturbed accompaniment.
&ldquo;Grecian Dance&rdquo; begins with a vivacious dance tune for two flutes in
thirds. A slow dialogue ensues between oboes and clarinets, in which
the main subject has an Oriental identity. A fast section brings this
movement to a close. &ldquo;<i>Sc&egrave;ne religieuse</i>&rdquo; is a graceful, at times solemn,
minuet in which a solo cello provides the main melody.</p>
<p>The famous opera <i>Manon</i> (1884) has two delightful dance episodes
that are particularly well known, a gavotte and a minuet. <i>Manon</i> was
based on the famous tale of Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, <i>L&rsquo;Histoire du chevalier des
Grieux et de Manon Lescaut</i>, adapted by Henri Meilhac and Philippe
Gille. Its setting is France in the 18th century, and in the spirit of that
place and time Massenet recreated two old-world dances, both of them
appearing in the first scene of the third act, during a festival-day celebration
in Paris. Before the curtain goes up, the graceful music of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
minuet is heard in the orchestra as an entr&rsquo;acte. After the rise of the curtain,
and the appearance of Manon, she expresses her hedonistic philosophy
of life in a gavotte (&ldquo;<i>Ob&eacute;issons quand leur voix appelle</i>&rdquo;). This
gavotte is often heard in an exclusively instrumental arrangement.</p>
<p>The <i>Ph&egrave;dre Overture</i> (1876) is another of Massenet&rsquo;s frequently performed
orchestral compositions. The music closely follows the action
of the Racine tragedy, in which Phedre&mdash;daughter of King Minos and
wife of Theseus&mdash;falls in love with Theseus&rsquo; son, Hippolytus, who fails
to respond to her passion. The overture begins in a gloomy mood, forecasting
ominously the imminent tragedy awaiting Phedre and Hippolytus.
Phedre&rsquo;s grief over her unreciprocated love is suggested by a
passionate subject for clarinet; a second equally passionate melody
brings us the picture of Hippolytus sent to his doom by an irate father.
Violins in unison now bring us a rapturous melody speaking of Phedre&rsquo;s
love, while a fiery dramatic section that follows tells of the doom awaiting
Hippolytus at the hands of Neptune.</p>
<p><i>Picturesque Scenes</i> (<i>Sc&egrave;nes pittoresques</i>) is the fourth of Massenet&rsquo;s
suites for orchestra, completed in 1873. There are four short, tuneful
sections: &ldquo;March&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Marche</i>&rdquo;), &ldquo;Air de Ballet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bohemian
Festival&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>F&ecirc;te boh&egrave;me</i>&rdquo;). The religious music of the third movement,
&ldquo;Angelus,&rdquo; with its solemn tolling of bells, is the most popular
section of this suite, frequently performed separately from the other
movements.</p>
<p>Second only to the &ldquo;<i>&Eacute;l&eacute;gie</i>&rdquo; in popularity among Massenet&rsquo;s best-loved
melodies is the &ldquo;Meditation&rdquo; which comes from the opera <i>Tha&iuml;s</i>.
This excerpt is an orchestral entr&rsquo;acte with violin obbligato heard just
before the first scene of the second act. The opera, libretto by Louis
Gallet based on the novel of Anatole France, describes the degradation
of Athana&euml;l, a Cenobite monk, because of his unholy passion for Tha&iuml;s,
a courtesan. The radiant music of the &ldquo;Meditation&rdquo; describes Tha&iuml;s&rsquo;
renunciation of a life of pleasure for one of the spirit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<h2 id="c120"><span class="small">Robert <b id="g_Mcbride">McBride</b></span></h2>
<p>Robert Guyn McBride was born in Tucson, Arizona,
on February 20, 1911. As a boy he learned to play the clarinet and saxophone.
He later played both instruments in various dance orchestras.
In 1933 he was graduated from the University of Arizona, and a year
after that received there his Master&rsquo;s degree. Having studied the oboe in
college, he played that instrument with the Tucson Symphony for several
years. Then, after additional study of the piano, composition and
voice, he joined the music faculty of Bennington College in Vermont
in 1935, holding this post eleven years. During this period he received a
Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1942, the American Academy of Arts and
Letters awarded him a prize for creating a &ldquo;new idiom in American
music.&rdquo; McBride has made successful use of jazz, popular and folk elements
in serious chamber-music and orchestral compositions.</p>
<p>The <i>Mexican Rhapsody</i> (1936) is one of McBride&rsquo;s best known works
for orchestra. He wrote it in Arizona while studying at the University.
It was first presented in Tucson in a two-piano arrangement, then in its
definitive orchestral version, and finally as a choreographic presentation.
McBride here makes a colorful and freshly conceived presentation
of four Mexican folk songs familiar to many: &ldquo;<i>El Rancho Grande</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Jarabe</i>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Hat Dance&rdquo;), &ldquo;<i>Cuatro Milpas</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>La Cucaracha</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McBride has written several interesting compositions in a jazz style.
One of the best is the <i>Strawberry Jam</i> (1942). This is a caricature of a
jazzband jam session, but with the utilization of modern harmonies and
symphonic orchestration. <i>Stuff in G</i>, for orchestra (1942), is in the racy,
tuneful style of Tin Pan Alley, while <i>Swing Stuff</i> (1941) brings to the
symphonic orchestra the improvisational devices and techniques and
the beat of Swing music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c121"><span class="small">Harl <b id="g_Mcdonald">McDonald</b></span></h2>
<p>Harl Mcdonald was born in Boulder, Colorado, on July
27, 1899. His music study took place in Redlands, California and at the
University of Southern California. The winning of prizes from the
American Federation of Music Clubs for two orchestral works enabled
him to go to Europe and attend the Leipzig Conservatory. In Germany,
his symphonic fantasy, <i>Mojave</i>, was successfully introduced by the Berlin
State Opera Orchestra. After returning to the United States he was
appointed in 1926 to the music faculty of the University of Pennsylvania,
where he later became professor of music, and finally head of the
music department. At the University he conducted various choral
groups which appeared with the Philadelphia Orchestra. From 1939
until his death he was manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra, which
introduced many of his orchestral compositions. McDonald wrote four
symphonies, a two-piano concerto, a violin concerto, and various suites
and tone poems for orchestra. He died in Princeton, New Jersey, on
March 30, 1955.</p>
<p>The <i>Children&rsquo;s Symphony</i> was a work intended to teach children
something about symphonic form through melodies they knew and
loved. The form of the symphony is adhered to&mdash;in the presentation of
two themes, their development, and recapitulation. Simple and unsophisticated,
this symphony makes ideal listening for children, but
there is enough charm here to provide considerable enjoyment to older
people as well. In the first movement, McDonald uses for his two main
themes, &ldquo;London Bridge&rdquo; and &ldquo;Baa Baa Black Sheep.&rdquo; In the second
movement we hear &ldquo;Little Bo Peep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh, Dear, What Can the
Matter Be?&rdquo;; in the third, &ldquo;Farmer in the Dell&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jingle Bells&rdquo;;
and in the finale, &ldquo;Honey Bee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Snow Is Falling On My Garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rhumba</i>, for symphony orchestra, is the third movement of McDonald&rsquo;s
Symphony No. 2 (1935). But this movement (which in the
symphony displaces the conventional scherzo) is so popular that it is
often played apart from the rest of the work. The symphony itself was
inspired by the turbulent 1930&rsquo;s, with its labor conflicts, breadlines,
unemployment, and depression. <i>Rhumba</i> injected a gay note into these
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
somber proceedings, attempting to interpret &ldquo;the passionate search
after good times and diversions, and the restless pursuit of intoxicated
pleasures,&rdquo; as the composer explained. McDonald goes on to say that
he here used the rumba rhythm because he liked it and because it
seemed to him to be the pulse of those times.</p>
<h2 id="c122"><span class="small">Felix <b id="g_Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</b></span></h2>
<p>Felix Mendelssohn-bartholdy was born in
Hamburg, Germany, on February 3, 1809. His grandfather was the
famous philosopher, Moses Mendelssohn; his father, a successful
banker. Both were of Jewish origin. When Felix was still a boy, however,
his immediate family was converted to Protestantism, the occasion
upon which they added the name of &ldquo;Bartholdy&rdquo; to their own to distinguish
them from the other members of their family. A pupil of
Ludwig Berger and Karl Friedrich Zelter, Felix was extraordinarily
precocious in music. When he was seven and a half he made a successful
appearance as pianist in Berlin; by the time he was twelve he had
already written operas and symphonies; and in his seventeenth year he
produced an unqualified masterwork in the <i>Overture to A Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>. In 1827, one of his operas was produced in Berlin, but
by that time he had already completed thirteen symphonies and a
library of chamber music as well.</p>
<p>In 1829, Mendelssohn conducted in Berlin the first performance of
Bach&rsquo;s <i>Passion According to St. Matthew</i> to be given since Bach&rsquo;s own
day. This concert became a powerful influence in reviving interest in
Bach&rsquo;s music, which at that time had been languishing in both neglect
and obscurity. A few weeks after Mendelssohn had directed a repeat
performance, he made his first trip to England where he led the premi&egrave;re
of a new symphony and was made honorary member of the Royal
Philharmonic. A tour of Scotland that followed immediately was the
inspiration for his overture, <i>Fingal&rsquo;s Cave</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>In 1833, Mendelssohn served as musical director of the city of Duesseldorf.
He held this post only six months. Much more significant was
his engagement as the principal conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra
in Leipzig in 1835 which, during the five years of his leadership, was
elevated to a position of first importance among the world&rsquo;s symphony
orchestras.</p>
<p>In 1841, Mendelssohn became head of the music department of a
projected Academy of Arts in Berlin. This appointment did not prevent
him from visiting England where he was received with an adulation
accorded to no foreign musician since Handel. Returning to Berlin
he found that the Academy of Arts project had been abandoned.
He was now made Kapellmeister to the King, an honorary post allowing
him complete freedom of activity and movement. During the next
few years he conducted concerts of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, and
paid two more highly successful visits to England. He was also instrumental
in helping to found the Leipzig Conservatory in 1843. Always
of delicate health and sensibilities, Mendelssohn collapsed at the news
that his beloved sister, Fanny, died in 1847. He died in Leipzig soon
after that, on November 4, 1847.</p>
<p>The finest qualities of German Romantic music can be found in
Mendelssohn. He had the Romantic&rsquo;s partiality for fantasy and the
supernatural, together with the lightness of touch with which to create
such worlds through music. He had the Romantic&rsquo;s gift for translating
natural scenes, landscapes and lyric poetry into sensitive tone pictures.
He had a most winning lyricism and graceful harmonic and orchestral
gift, and he never lacked the ability to charm and enchant his listeners
with the most tender and lovable musical expression. Other composers
may have written profounder or more emotionally stirring music than
Mendelssohn; but no one could be more ingratiating, sensitive, or
refined. Some of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s serious symphonic works are so full of
the most wonderful melodies and beguiling moods that they have the
universal appeal of semi-classics.</p>
<p>The concert overture, <i>Fingal&rsquo;s Cave</i>, or as it is also sometimes known,
<i>Hebrides Overture</i>, op. 26 (1832) was inspired by the composer&rsquo;s visit
to the Scottish Highlands in 1830. The opening theme in lower strings
and bassoons suggests the roll of the waves at the mouth of a cave, a
melody that came to the composer while visiting the caves of Staffa.
This idea is developed, then a second beautiful melody unfolds in cellos
and bassoons.</p>
<p>The orchestral suite, <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, op. 61 is derived
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
from the incidental music comprising thirteen numbers which Mendelssohn
wrote for a Potsdam production of the Shakespeare comedy in
1843; the Overture, however, was a fruit of the composer&rsquo;s youth, having
been written in 1826. The magic world of fairies and elves which
Mendelssohn projected so delicately in his youthful overture is preserved
in many of the numbers he wrote seventeen years later. The
Overture, op. 21, is initiated with four sensitive chords, and proceeds
with fleeting, diaphanous music for strings with which we are suddenly
plunged in fairyland. The main thematic material to follow comprises
a haunting song for horn, a romantic episode for woodwind and strings,
and a sprightly fairy dance for strings.</p>
<p>Three other musical sections from this incidental music, and basic to
the orchestral suite, are famous. The &ldquo;Nocturne&rdquo; is a broad, moody
song for horns. The &ldquo;Scherzo&rdquo;&mdash;like the Overture&mdash;is a picture of the
world of fairies, gnomes and elves, though in a more energetic and
spirited vein. The &ldquo;Wedding March&rdquo; is now one of the most frequently
played pieces of wedding music, second in popularity only to Wagner&rsquo;s
wedding music from <i>Lohengrin</i>; it first became popular as wedding
music at the nuptials of the English Princess in London in 1858. A
trumpet fanfare leads to the dignified march melody which is twice
alternated with melodious trio sections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Wings of Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Auf Fluegeln des Gesanges</i>&rdquo;), op. 34, no. 2
(1834) is Mendelssohn&rsquo;s best-known song, a melody of incomparable
loveliness and serenity. The poem is by Heine. Franz Liszt transcribed it
for piano; Joseph Achron for violin and piano; Lionel Tertis for viola
and piano. It has also enjoyed various orchestral transcriptions.</p>
<p><i>Ruy Blas</i>, op. 95 (1839)&mdash;like <i>Fingal&rsquo;s Cave</i>&mdash;is a concert overture for
orchestra; here the inspiration is the drama of Victor Hugo. Four
solemn bars for wind instruments lead to the principal subject, first
violins and flutes; clarinets, bassoons, and cellos later offer the second
contrasting staccato theme.</p>
<p>The <i>Spinning Song</i> and the <i>Spring Song</i> are both instrumental
favorites, and both come from the <i>Songs Without Words</i> (<i>Lieder ohne
Worte</i>), for solo piano. The form of &ldquo;song without words&rdquo; is a creation
of Mendelssohn: a brief composition of such essentially lyric character
that it is virtually a &ldquo;song&rdquo; for the piano. Mendelssohn wrote forty-eight
such pieces gathered in eight books. The <i>Spinning Song</i> in C
major appears in op. 67 as the fourth number (1844). This is a tender
melody placed against a rhythmic background suggesting the whirring
of a spinning wheel. The <i>Spring Song</i> in A major is surely one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
most familiar tonal pictures of the vernal season to be found in the
semi-classical literature; it appears in op. 62 (1842) as the concluding
number. Both the <i>Spinning Song</i> and <i>Spring Song</i> appear in all kinds
and varieties of transcriptions.</p>
<p>The stirring <i>War March of the Priests</i> is a number from the incidental
music for Racine&rsquo;s drama, <i>Athalie</i>, op. 74 (1843); this incidental
music was first performed with the Racine play in Berlin in 1845.</p>
<h2 id="c123"><span class="small">Giacomo <b id="g_Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</b></span></h2>
<p>Giacomo Meyerbeer was born in Berlin, Germany, on
September 5, 1791. His name, at birth, was Jakob Liebmann Beer.
When Meyer, a rich relative, left him a legacy, he decided to change his
name to Meyerbeer; some years later upon initiating a career as composer
of Italian operas he Italianized his name. His music study took
place with Clementi, Zelter, Anselm Weber and Vogler, the last of
whom encouraged him to write his first opera, <i>Jephtha&rsquo;s Vow</i> (<i>Jephtha&rsquo;s
Geluebde</i>), a failure when first performed in Munich in 1812. A second
opera, performed in Stuttgart, was also a failure; Meyerbeer now seriously
entertained the thought of abandoning composition altogether.
The noted Viennese composer and teacher, Antonio Salieri, however,
convinced him what he needed was more study. This took place in Italy
where for several years Meyerbeer assimilated Italian traditions of
opera. His first endeavor in this style was <i>Romilda e Costanza</i>, a success
when introduced in Padua in 1817. During the next few years Meyerbeer
wrote several more operas, some of them on commission, and became
one of Italy&rsquo;s most highly regarded composers for the stage. In
1826, Meyerbeer settled in Paris where association with composers like
Cherubini and Hal&eacute;vy, made him impatient with the kind of operas he
had thus far created. In 1831, with <i>Robert le Diable</i>, he entered upon a
new artistic phase in which Italian methods, procedures and traditions
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
were discarded in favor of the French. <i>Robert le Diable</i>, produced at
the Opera on November 21, 1831 was a sensation. Meyerbeer continued
writing operas in the French style for the remainder of his life. These
are the operas by which he is most often represented in the world&rsquo;s
opera theaters: <i>Les Huguenots</i> (1836), <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i> (1849), and <i>L&rsquo;Africaine</i>
(1865). Meyerbeer died in Paris on May 2, 1864.</p>
<p>Meyerbeer was an exponent of drama in the grand style, his finest
operas being filled with big climactic scenes, elaborate stage effects, and
eye-filling visual displays. But he also had a pronounced dramatic gift,
one which evoked from Wagner the highest admiration; and a pronounced
expressiveness of lyricism.</p>
<p><i>L&rsquo;Africaine</i> (<i>The African</i>) is Meyerbeer&rsquo;s last opera, and many regarded
it as his best. He completed it in 1864 just before his death, and
its world premi&egrave;re at the Paris Opera took place posthumously on
April 28, 1865. The text, by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe, is set in Lisbon and Madagascar
in the 15th century. The main action concerns the love of Selika,
an African queen, for the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama; Da
Gama in turn is loved by Inez, daughter of Don Diego. Selika offers
the explorer a secret route to the land of which she is queen, Madagascar,
and with which Da Gama becomes enraptured. But when Inez
appears, he abandons Selika for her, and leaves the magic island. Heartbroken,
Selika kills herself by breathing the deadly fragrance of a
manchineel tree.</p>
<p>The opera&rsquo;s most popular excerpt is Vasco da Gama&rsquo;s rapturous tenor
aria from the fourth act in which he describes the beauty of Madagascar,
&ldquo;<i>O Paradis</i>.&rdquo; Another vocal favorite is the baritone ballad of
Nelusko, slave of Selika, &ldquo;<i>Adamastor, roi des vagues profondes</i>&rdquo;; as he
steers the ship bearing Selika and Vasco da Gama to Madagascar he sings
of Adamastor, monarch of the sea, who sends ships to their doom on
treacherous reefs.</p>
<p>The <i>Coronation March</i> (<i>Marche du couronnement</i>)&mdash;music of pomp
and circumstance&mdash;comes from the opera <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i>, first performed
at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on April 16, 1849. Eug&egrave;ne Scribe&rsquo;s libretto is based
on an actual historical episode in 16th century Holland centered around
the Anabaptist uprising, with John of Leyden, leader of the Anabaptists,
as the principal character. In Act four, scene two, John is being
crowned king outside the Muenster Cathedral. As a magnificent royal
procession enters the Cathedral, the music of the <i>Coronation March</i>
matches in splendor and grandeur the visual majesty of this scene. Another
popular musical excerpt for orchestra from this opera is Prelude
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
to Act 3, a colorful and rhythmic Quadrille that leads into the opening
scene of that act, providing the lively musical background for a ballet
and ice-carnival skating scene. Liszt made a technically brilliant transcription
for the piano of this Quadrille music.</p>
<p><i>Les Huguenots</i> (<i>The Huguenots</i>) was first performed at the Paris
Op&eacute;ra on February 29, 1836, the year it was completed; the libretto was
by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe and &Eacute;mile Deschamps. In 16th century Touraine and
Paris, Raoul, a Huguenot nobleman, has saved the life of Valentine,
daughter of the Catholic leader, St. Bris. She falls in love with Raoul,
but the latter repudiates her, believing her to be the mistress of Count
de Nevers. When he discovers he has been mistaken, Raoul risks his
life to see her. During this visit he overhears a Catholic plot to massacre
the Huguenots. After Raoul and Valentine get married, they are both
murdered in the massacre&mdash;Valentine by her own father.</p>
<p>The Overture to <i>Les Huguenots</i> is built almost entirely from the
melody of the famous Lutheran chorale, <i>Ein&rsquo; feste Burg</i>, which in the
opera itself served as the musical symbol for militant Protestantism.
The outstanding individual excerpts from the opera include Raoul&rsquo;s
beautiful romance from Act 1 describing the woman he has saved,
&ldquo;<i>Plus blanche que la blanche hermine</i>&rdquo;; the rhapsodic description in
the second act of the Touraine countryside by Marguerite de Valois,
betrothed to Henry IV of Navarre, &ldquo;<i>O beau pays de la Touraine</i>&rdquo;; and
in the fourth act the stirring &ldquo;Benediction of the Swords,&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Gloire au
grand Dieu vengeur</i>&rdquo;) with which the Catholics are blessed by three
monks on the eve of their holy war against the Huguenots.</p>
<p>The exciting <i>Torch Dance</i>, No. 1, in B-flat is not from one of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s
operas. It was written in 1846 for the wedding of the King of
Bavaria, and originally was scored for brass band. It is now most frequently
heard in orchestral adaptations. Meyerbeer subsequently wrote
two other <i>Torch Dances</i>: the second in 1850 for the wedding of Princess
Charlotte of Prussia, and the third in 1853 for the wedding of
Princess Anne of Prussia.</p>

<h2 id="c124"><span class="small">Karl <b id="g_Milloecker">Milloecker</b></span></h2>
<p>Karl Milloecker was born in Vienna, Austria, on May
29, 1842. His father, a jeweler, wanted him to enter the family business,
but from his childhood on, Karl was drawn to music. After studying
music with private teachers, he attended the Conservatory of the
Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Meanwhile, in his sixteenth year, he
supported himself by playing the flute in a theater orchestra. When his
music study ended, he became conductor of a theater in Graz in 1864;
there his first operetta was produced one year later. In 1866 he was back
in Vienna, and from 1869 to 1883 he was principal conductor at the
Theater-an-der-Wien where most of his famous operettas were produced
including <i>Countess Du Barry</i> (<i>Graefin DuBarry</i>) in 1879, <i>The
Beggar Student</i> (<i>Der Bettelstudent</i>) in 1882, <i>Gasparone</i> in 1884, and
<i>Poor Jonathan</i> (<i>Der arme Jonathan</i>) in 1890. Milloecker died in Baden,
near Vienna, on December 31, 1899.</p>
<p>Milloecker&rsquo;s most famous operetta is <i>The Beggar Student</i> (<i>Der Bettelstudent</i>),
which was first produced at the Theater-an-der-Wien in
Vienna on December 6, 1882, and after that enjoyed highly successful
performances at the Casino Theater in New York in 1883, and the
Alhambra in London in 1884. The scene is Cracow, Poland; the time,
1704. General Ollendorf, spurned by Laura, evolves an elaborate plot
to avenge himself. He finances the impoverished student, Symon,
dresses him up as a lord, and sends him off to woo and win Laura. Only
after the wedding does the General reveal the fact that Symon is a beggar.
Just as disgrace faces the young man, he becomes involved in a
successful maneuver to restore the rejected Polish king to his throne.
Thus he acquires wealth and a title, and is welcomed with pride and
love by Laura and her mother. Potpourris and selections from this tuneful
operetta always include the principal waltz melody which comes as
a first act finale, &ldquo;<i>Ach ich hab&rsquo; sie ja nur auf die Schulter gekuesst</i>.&rdquo;
Other delightful excerpts include Symon&rsquo;s mazurka, &ldquo;<i>Ich knuepfte
manche zarte Bande</i>,&rdquo; his lament &ldquo;<i>Ich hab&rsquo; kein Geld</i>,&rdquo; and the second
act duet of Symon and Laura, &ldquo;<i>Ich setz den Fall</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c125"><span class="small">Moritz <b id="g_Moszkowski">Moszkowski</b></span></h2>
<p>Moritz Moszkowski was born in Breslau, Germany,
on August 23, 1854. He received his musical training at three leading
German Conservatories: the Dresden Conservatory, the Stern Conservatory
and Kullak Academy in Berlin. He began a career as pianist
in 1873, touring Europe with outstanding success. He also achieved
recognition as a teacher of the piano at the Kullak Academy. In 1897,
he went into retirement in Paris where he lived for the remainder of
his life. In 1899 he was elected a member of the Berlin Academy. Towards
the end of his life his financial resources were completely depleted,
and his fame as composer, pianist, and teacher had long been
eclipsed. He died in poverty and obscurity in Paris on March 4, 1925.</p>
<p>Though he wrote operas, ballets, suites, concertos and a symphony,
Moszkowski was at his best&mdash;and is most famous today&mdash;for his lighter
music in a Spanish idiom. Typical of his music in this style were the
rhythmic <i>Bolero</i>, op. 12, no. 5, for piano solo; the languorous and
haunting <i>Guitarre</i>, op. 45, no. 2, for piano solo (transcribed by Pablo
de Sarasate for violin and piano); and the dashing <i>Malague&ntilde;a</i>, from the
opera <i>Boabdil</i>.</p>
<p>But his most celebrated compositions are the delightful <i>Spanish
Dances</i>, opp. 12, and 65, two books of pieces for piano solo or piano duo,
which have been arranged for orchestra. The most popular are the first
in C major, the second in G minor, and the fifth (a bolero) in D major.
While none of these dances can be accepted as authentic Spanish music&mdash;actually
they are only a German Romantic&rsquo;s conception of what
Spanish music is&mdash;they make most effective use of Spanish dance
rhythms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c126"><span class="small">Wolfgang Amadeus <b id="g_Mozart">Mozart</b></span></h2>
<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg,
Austria, on January 27, 1756. The son of Leopold, Kapellmeister
at the court of the Salzburg Archbishop, Wolfgang Amadeus disclosed
his remarkable musical powers at a tender age. He began composition
at the age of five, completed a piano sonata at seven, and a symphony at
eight. Taught the harpsichord, also very early in his childhood, he revealed
such phenomenal abilities at improvisation and sight reading
that he was the wonder and awe of all who came into contact with him.
His ambitious father exhibited this formidable prodigy for several years
before the crowned heads of Europe; and wherever he appeared the
child was acclaimed. Goethe said: &ldquo;A phenomenon like that of Mozart
remains an inexplicable thing.&rdquo; In Milan in 1770 he was commissioned
to write an opera <i>Mitridate, r&egrave; di Ponto</i>, successfully performed that
year. In Bologna he became the only musician under the age of twenty
to be elected a member of the renowned Accademia Filarmonica. And
in Rome he provided dramatic evidence of his extraordinary natural
gifts by putting down on paper the entire complex score of Allegri&rsquo;s
<i>Miserere</i> after a single hearing.</p>
<p>As he outgrew childhood he ripened as a composer, gaining all the
time in both technical and creative powers. But he was a prodigy no
more, and though he was rapidly becoming one of the most profound
and original musicians in Europe he was unable to attract the adulation
and excitement that had once been his. Between 1772 and 1777, as an
employee in the musical establishment of the Salzburg Archbishop, he
was treated like a menial servant. The remarkable music he was writing
all the time passed unnoticed. Finally, in 1782, he made a permanent
break with the Archbishop and established his home in Vienna where
he lived for the remainder of his life. Though he received some important
commissions, and enjoyed several triumphs for his operas, he did
not fare any too well in Vienna either. He had to wait several years for
a court appointment, and when it finally came in 1787 he was deplorably
underpaid. Thus he lived in poverty, often dependent for food
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
and other necessities of life on the generosity of his friends. And yet
the masterworks kept coming in every conceivable medium&mdash;operas,
symphonies, sonatas, quartets, concertos, choral music and so forth. A
few people in Vienna were aware of his prodigious achievements, and
one of these was Joseph Haydn who called him &ldquo;the greatest composer
I know either personally or by name.&rdquo; During the last years of his life
Mozart was harassed not only by poverty but also by severe illness. Yet
his last year was one of his most productive, yielding his last three symphonies,
the <i>Requiem</i>, the opera <i>The Magic Flute</i> (<i>Die Zauberfloete</i>),
the <i>Ave Verum</i>, and a remarkable piano concerto and string quintet.
He died in Vienna on December 5, 1791 and was buried in a pauper&rsquo;s
grave with no tombstone or cross for identification.</p>
<p>Through his genius every form of music was endowed with new grandeur,
nobility of expression and richness of thought. He was a technician
second to none; a bold innovator; a creator capable of plumbing
the profoundest depths of emotion and the most exalted heights of
spirituality. Yet he could also be simple and charming and graceful, in
music remarkably overflowing with the most engaging melodies conceived
by man, and characterized by the most exquisite taste and the
most consummate craftsmanship. Thus Mozart&rsquo;s lighter moods in music
are often also endowed with extraordinary creative resources and original
invention; yet they never lose their capacity to delight audiences
at first contact.</p>
<p>The music Mozart wrote directly for popular consumption were the
hundred or so <i>Dances</i> for orchestra: <i>Country Dances</i>, <i>German Dances</i>,
<i>Minuets</i>. The greatest number of these consist of the <i>German Dances</i>.
These are lively melodies in eight-measure phrases and with forceful
peasant rhythms. Some of the best <i>German Dances</i> are those in which
Mozart utilized unusual orchestral resources or instruments to suggest
extra-musical sounds. <i>The Sleighride</i> (<i>Die Schlittenfahrt</i>), K. 605, in
C major, simulates the sound of sleigh bells in the middle trio section,
sounded in the tones A-F-E-C. <i>The Organgrinder</i> (<i>Der Leiermann</i>),
K. 602, imitates the sound of a hurdy-gurdy. In <i>The Canary</i> (<i>Der
Kanarienvogel</i>), K. 571, flutes reproduce the chirping of birds.</p>
<p>The <i>Country Dance</i>, or <i>Contretanze</i>, is sometimes regarded as the
first modern dance, forerunner of the quadrille. Structurally and stylistically
these are very much like <i>German Dances</i> with a peasant-like
vitality and earthiness. Here, too, Mozart sometimes realistically imitates
non-musical sounds as in <i>The Thunder Storm</i> (<i>Das Donnerwetter</i>),
K. 534, in which the role of the timpani suggests peals of thunder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Mozart&rsquo;s most popular Minuet&mdash;indeed, it is probably one of the
most popular minuets ever written&mdash;comes from his opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>,
libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, and first performed in Prague in
1787. The hero of this opera is, to be sure, the Spanish nobleman of the
17th century whose escapades and licentious life finally bring him to
doom at the hands of the statue of the Commandant come to life to
consign him to the fires of hell. The Minuet appears in the fifth scene
of the first act. Don Giovanni is the gracious host of a party held in his
palace, and there the guests dance a courtly minuet while Don himself
is making amatory overtures to Zerlina.</p>
<p>In a lighter mood, also, is the <i>Eine kleine Nachtmusik</i> (<i>A Little
Night Music</i>), K. 525, a serenade for string orchestra (1787). This work
is consistently tuneful, gracious, charming. The first movement has two
lilting little melodies, which are presented and recapitulated with no
formal development to speak of. The second movement is a Romance,
or Romanza, a poetic song contrasted by two vigorous sections; the
main thought of this movement is then repeated between each of these
two vigorous parts. After that comes a formal minuet, and the work
ends with a brisk and sprightly rondo.</p>
<p>Mozart&rsquo;s popular <i>Turkish March</i>&mdash;in the pseudo Turkish style so
popular in Vienna in his day&mdash;comes out of his piano Sonata in A major,
K. 331 (1778), where it appears as the last movement. This march is
extremely popular in orchestral transcription.</p>
<h2 id="c127"><span class="small">Modest <b id="g_Mussorgsky">Mussorgsky</b></span></h2>
<p>Modest Mussorgsky was born in Karevo, Russia, on
March 21, 1839. When he was thirteen he entered the cadet school of
the Imperial Guard in St. Petersburg, from which he was graduated
to join the Guard regiment. In 1857 he met and befriended several
important Russian musicians (including Balakirev and Stassov) under
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
whose stimulus he decided to leave the army and become a composer.
Until now his musical education had been sporadic, having consisted
of little more than some piano lessons with his mother and a private
teacher. He now began an intensive period of study with Balakirev,
under whose guidance he completed a <i>Scherzo</i> for orchestra which was
performed in St. Petersburg in 1860, as well as some piano music and the
fragments of a symphony. Associating himself with Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov,
Borodin, and Cui he now became a passionate advocate of
musical nationalism, becoming the fifth member of a new school of
Russian music henceforth identified as &ldquo;The Mighty Five&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Russian Five.&rdquo; In 1863, with serfdom abolished in Russia, he lost the
outside financial resources he had thus far enjoyed as the son of a landowner.
To support himself he worked for four years as a clerk in the
Ministry of Communications; in 1869 he found employment in the
forestry department. During this period music had to be relegated to
the position of an avocation, but composition was not abandoned. He
completed the first of his masterworks, the orchestral tone poem, <i>A
Night on the Bald Mountain</i>, in 1866. A lifelong victim of nervous disorders,
melancholia and subsequently of alcoholism, his health soon began
to deteriorate alarmingly; but despite this fact he was able to complete
several works of crowning significance in 1874 including his folk
opera, <i>Boris Godunov</i>, and his <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, for piano.
After 1874 his moral and physical disintegration became complete; towards
the last months of his life he gave indications of losing his mind.
He died in St. Petersburg on March 28, 1881.</p>
<p>As one of the most forceful and original members of the &ldquo;Russian
Five&rdquo; Mussorgsky&rsquo;s greatest works certainly do not lend themselves to
popular distribution. His writing is too individual in its melodic and
harmonic construction; and his works show too great a tendency towards
musical realism to make for palatable digest. However, several of the
folk dances in his operas are strikingly effective for their rhythmic
pulse and national colors and are by no means as elusive in their appeal
as the rest of his production.</p>
<p>Mussorgsky&rsquo;s masterwork is his mighty folk opera, <i>Boris Godunov</i>,
where we encounter one such delightful dance episode, the Polonaise.
<i>Boris Godunov</i>, libretto by the composer based on a Pushkin drama,
traces the career of the Czar from the years 1598 to 1605, from his
coronation to his insanity and death. The Polonaise occurs in the first
scene of the third act. At the palace of a Polish landowner, handsomely
costumed guests perform this festive courtly dance in the adjoining
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
garden. The premi&egrave;re of <i>Boris Godunov</i> took place in St. Petersburg
on February 8, 1874.</p>
<p>Two orchestral dances can also be found in another of Mussorgky&rsquo;s
folk operas, <i>The Fair at Sorochinsk</i>, which was not introduced until
October 26, 1917, in St. Petersburg. The libretto was by the composer
based on Gogol&rsquo;s story, <i>Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka</i>. Tcherevik,
a peasant, wants his daughter to marry Pritzko, whereas the peasant&rsquo;s
wife is partial to the pastor&rsquo;s son. However, when the pastor&rsquo;s son compromises
the peasant&rsquo;s wife she realizes that Pritzko is, after all, the right
man for her daughter. In the third act of this opera comes the lively
<i>Hopak</i>, or <i>Gopak</i>, a folk dance with two beats to a measure.</p>
<p>Folk dances of a completely different nature&mdash;more oriental and
exotic than the previously discussed Russian variety&mdash;will be found in
<i>Khovanschina</i>, a musical drama with libretto by the composer and
Stassov; this opera was first given, in an amateur performance, in St.
Petersburg on February 21, 1886. Here the setting is Moscow during
the reign of Peter the Great, and the plot revolves around the efforts of
a band of radicals known as the Streltsy who try to overthrow the Czar.
Prince Ivan Khovantsky, who is in league with the Streltsy, is murdered
by assassins, and the insurrection is suppressed. But before the
leaders of the Streltsy can destroy themselves they are given an official
pardon by the Czar. A high moment in this opera comes with the
<i>Dances of the Persian Slaves</i>, which takes place in the first scene of the
fourth act. At the country house of Khovantsky, the Prince is being
entertained by an elaborate spectacle, the main attraction of which is
the sinuous, Corybantic dancing of the Persian slaves.</p>
<p>Almost as popular as these Persian dances are the Prelude to the first
act and an entr&rsquo;acte between the first and second scenes from this opera;
these two episodes for orchestra are highly atmospheric, graphic in the
pictures of Russian landscapes. The first act Prelude has been named
by the composer, <i>Dawn on the Moskava River</i>. This is a subtle tone
picture made up of a folk melody and five variations. The entr&rsquo;acte
offers another kind of landscape, this time a bleak one describing the
vast, lonely plains of Siberia.</p>

<h2 id="c128"><span class="small">Ethelbert <b id="g_Nevin">Nevin</b></span></h2>
<p>Ethelbert Woodbridge Nevin was born in
Edgeworth, Pennsylvania, on November 25, 1862. A precocious child
in music, he wrote his first piano piece when he was eleven. A year later
he wrote and had published a song that became exceedingly popular,
&ldquo;Good Night, Good Night Beloved.&rdquo; After studying music with private
teachers, he went to Berlin in 1884, studying for two years with Hans
von Buelow and Karl Klindworth. He returned to the United States
in 1886. Soon after that he made his formal American concert debut as
pianist with a program on which he included some of his own compositions.
By 1890 he decided to give up his career as a virtuoso and to
concentrate on being a composer. In 1891 he completed <i>Water Scenes</i>,
a suite for the piano in which will be found one of the most popular
piano pieces by an American, &ldquo;Narcissus.&rdquo; In 1892 and again 1895
Nevin traveled extensively through Europe and Morocco. In 1897 he
settled in New York City where he wrote one of the best-selling art
songs by an American, &ldquo;The Rosary.&rdquo; In 1900 Nevin went to live in
New Haven. During the last year of his life he was a victim of depressions
which he tried to alleviate through excessive drinking. He died of
an apoplectic stroke in New Haven, Connecticut, on February 17, 1901.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty Lak a Rose&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rosary&rdquo; are Nevin&rsquo;s two most
famous art songs; they are also among the most popular art songs written
in America. &ldquo;Mighty Lak a Rose&rdquo; was one of Nevin&rsquo;s last compositions,
written during the closing months of his life. He never lived to
see the song published and become popular. The song is a setting of a
poem by Frank L. Stanton, and is described by John Trasker Howard
(Nevin&rsquo;s biographer) as &ldquo;probably the simplest of all his songs ...
[with] a freshness and whimsical tenderness that make its appeal direct
and forceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rosary,&rdquo; words by R. C. Rogers, was an even greater success.
From 1898 to 1928 it sold over two and a half million copies of sheet
music. When Nevin had finished writing this song in 1898, he invited
the singer Francis Rogers to dinner, after which he handed him a
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
scribbled piece of music paper. &ldquo;Here is a song I just composed,&rdquo; he
told Rogers. &ldquo;I want you to sing it at your concert next week.&rdquo; Rogers
deciphered the notes as best he could while Nevin played the accompaniment
from memory. The little audience listening to this first informal
presentation of &ldquo;The Rosary&rdquo; was enthusiastic, but one of its
members insisted it would be impossible for Rogers to memorize the
song in time for the concert the following week. The guest bet Nevin
a champagne supper for all present that the song would not be on
Rogers&rsquo; program. He lost the bet. The following week, on February 15,
1898, Rogers introduced the song at the Madison Square Concert Hall.</p>
<p>The <i>Water Scenes</i>, suite for piano, op. 13 is remembered principally
because one of its movements is &ldquo;Narcissus,&rdquo; often considered one of
the most popular compositions ever written in this country. Nevin himself
provided information about the origin of &ldquo;Narcissus.&rdquo; &ldquo;I remembered
vaguely that there was once a Grecian lad who had something to
do with the water and who was called Narcissus. I rummaged about my
old mythology and read the story over again. The theme, or rather both
themes, came as I read. I went directly to my desk and wrote out the
whole composition. Afterwards, I rewrote it and revised it a little. The
next morning I sent it to my publishers. Until the proofs came back to
me I never tried it on the piano. I left almost immediately for Europe
and was surprised when a publisher wrote to me of the astonishing sale
of the piece.&rdquo; During Nevin&rsquo;s lifetime, the piece sold over 125,000
copies of sheet music, and was heard throughout America both in its
original piano version (a favorite repertory number of piano students
and budding piano virtuosos) and in transcriptions. It went on to circle
the globe. As Vance Thompson wrote: &ldquo;It was thrummed and whistled
half around the world. It was played in Cairo as in New York and
Paris; it was played by orchestras, on church organs, and on the mouth
harps of Klondike miners; it became a mode, almost a mania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other movements of <i>Water Scenes</i> are: &ldquo;Barcarolle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dragon
Fly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Water Nymph,&rdquo; &ldquo;At Twilight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ophelia.&rdquo; Each is a sensitive
piece of tone painting, as lyrical and as unashamedly sentimental
as the beloved &ldquo;Narcissus.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c129"><span class="small">Otto <b id="g_Nicolai">Nicolai</b></span></h2>
<p>Otto Nicolai was born in Koenigsberg, Germany, on June
9, 1810. After completing his music study with Zelter and Bernhard
Klein, he came to Paris in 1830 where he remained three years. In Berlin
he completed several works for orchestra, and some for chorus. In
1834 he went to Italy where he was organist in the Prussian Embassy at
Rome and became interested in opera. From 1837 to 1838 he was principal
conductor at the Kaerthnerthor Theater in Vienna. Then he returned
to Italy to devote himself to the writing of operas, the first of
which, <i>Rosmonda d&rsquo;Inghilterra</i> was a failure when produced in Turin
in 1838. His second opera, however, was a major success when first
given in Turin in 1840: <i>Il Templario</i> based on Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
<i>Ivanhoe</i>; it was produced in Naples and Vienna. In 1841 Nicolai came
to Vienna to serve for six years as Kapellmeister to the court. During
this period, in 1842, he helped to found the renowned Vienna Philharmonic
Orchestra. In 1847 he came to Berlin to become conductor of the
Domchor. It was here that he completed the work upon which his reputation
rests, the comic opera, <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> (<i>Die lustigen
Weiber von Windsor</i>). He died in Berlin of an apoplectic stroke on
May 11, 1849, only two months after the premi&egrave;re performance of his
famous comic opera.</p>
<p><i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> (<i>Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor</i>) is
Nicolai&rsquo;s only opera to survive; and its overture is his only work for
orchestra which retains its popularity. The opera received a highly successful
premi&egrave;re in Berlin on March 8, 1849. Its libretto, by Hermann
Salomon Mosenthal, is based on Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedy and follows that
play with only minor modifications. Falstaff&rsquo;s cronies (Bardolph, Pistol
and Nym) are omitted; only slight reference is made to the love of
Anne and Fenton; and considerable attention is paid to Falstaff&rsquo;s
comical amatory overtures to Mistresses Ford and Page.</p>
<p>The overture opens with a slow introduction in which a flowing
melody is given against a high G in the violins. This melody is repeated
by several different sections of the orchestra, then treated in imitation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
The main part of the overture is made up of two vivacious melodies,
the second of which, in the violins, is intended to depict Mistress Page.
The development of both themes is in a gay mood, with a robust passage
in F minor representing Falstaff. The overture concludes with an
animated coda.</p>
<p>From the opera itself come three melodious vocal selections, prominent
in all orchestral potpourris: Falstaff&rsquo;s drinking song, a long time
favorite of German bassos, &ldquo;<i>Als Bueblein klein</i>&rdquo;; Fenton&rsquo;s serenade to
Anne Page, &ldquo;<i>Horch, die Lerche singt in Haim</i>&rdquo;; and Mistress Page&rsquo;s
third-act ballad of Herne the Hunter.</p>
<h2 id="c130"><span class="small">Siegfried <b id="g_Ochs">Ochs</b></span></h2>
<p>Siegfried Ochs was born in Frankfort on the Main, Germany,
on April 19, 1858. While studying medicine, he attended the
Berlin High School for Music. Then deciding upon music as a life&rsquo;s
career, he continued his music study with private teachers and became
a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Hans von Buelow. In 1882 he founded the Philharmonic
Choir of Berlin, one of Germany&rsquo;s most celebrated choral groups. He
remained its conductor even after it merged with the chorus of the
Berlin High School for Music in 1920. Ochs died in Berlin on February
6, 1929.</p>
<p>Ochs wrote several comic operas, song cycles, and some choral music.
A semi-classical favorite is the set of orchestral variations on the well-known
German folk song, &ldquo;<i>Kommt ein Vogel</i>.&rdquo; These variations are
each in the style of a famous composer&mdash;Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,
Wagner, Johann Strauss II, and so on; and each variation shows a remarkable
skill, and a winning wit, in mimicking the individual creative
mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of each composer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c131"><span class="small">Jacques <b id="g_Offenbach">Offenbach</b></span></h2>
<p>Jacques Offenbach was born Jacques Oberst in Cologne,
Germany, on June 20, 1819; his father was a cantor in one of the
city synagogues. After attending the Paris Conservatory, Offenbach
played the cello in the orchestra of the Op&eacute;ra-Comique. Then, in 1849
he became conductor at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais. In 1850 he achieved his
initial success as a composer with the song, &ldquo;<i>Chanson de Fortunio</i>&rdquo; interpolated
into a production of the Alfred de Musset drama, <i>Chandelier</i>.
Three years later his first operetta, <i>Pepito</i>, was produced at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s. Between 1855 and 1866 he directed his own theater
where operettas were given, Les Bouffes Parisiens, which opened
on July 5, 1855 with a performance of one of his own works, <i>Les Deux
aveugles</i>. For his theater Offenbach wrote many operettas including his
masterwork in that genre, <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i>, in 1858. After
closing down the Bouffes Parisiens, Offenbach went to Germany and
Austria where he had produced several more of his operettas. But in
1864 he was back in Paris. The premi&egrave;re of <i>La Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i> at the
Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s that year enjoyed a spectacular success. Among his later operettas
were <i>La Vie parisienne</i> (1866), <i>La Grande Duchesse de G&eacute;rolstein</i>
(1867), and <i>La P&eacute;richole</i> (1868). In 1877 he toured the United States,
an account of which was issued in America in 1957 under the title of
<i>Orpheus in America</i>. Towards the end of his life Offenbach devoted
himself to the writing of his one and only grand opera, <i>The Tales of
Hoffmann</i> (<i>Les Contes d&rsquo;Hoffmann</i>). He did not live to see it performed.
He died in Paris on October 5, 1880, about half a year before
the premi&egrave;re of his opera at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique on February 10, 1881.</p>
<p>Offenbach was the genius of the op&eacute;ra-bouffe, or French operetta.
His music never lacked spontaneity or gaiety, sparkle or engaging
lyricism. His writing had the warmth of laughter, the sting of satire,
and the caress of sincere and heartfelt emotion. His lovable melodies
woo and win the listener. The lightness of his touch and the freshness
of his humor give voice to the joy of good living. Like his celebrated
Viennese contemporary, Johann Strauss II, Offenbach is a giant figure
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
in semi-classical music. To the lighter musical repertory he brings the
invention and imagination of a master.</p>
<p>The <i>Apache Dance</i> is the dashing music that invariably accompanies
a performance of French Apache dances, though there are few that
know Offenbach wrote it. Actually, the <i>Apache Dance</i> is an adaptation
of the main melody of a waltz (&ldquo;<i>Valse des Papillons</i>&rdquo;) from Offenbach&rsquo;s
comic opera, <i>Le Roi Carotte</i> (1872).</p>
<p><i>La Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i> (<i>Fair Helen</i>), first performed in Paris on December
17, 1864, draws material for laughter and satire from mythology. Henri
Meilhac and Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy prepared the text which is based on the
love of Paris and Helen that led to the Trojan war. But this story is told
with tongue-in-cheek frivolity, and the life of the Greeks is gaily
parodied. One of the most familiar musical excerpts from <i>La Belle
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i> is whirling Can-Can music&mdash;the Can-Can being the voluptuous
French dance which first became popular in Paris in 1830 and which
contributed to the quadrille high kicks, skirt-lifting and other suggestive
and at times vulgar movements. (Offenbach also wrote brilliant
Can-Can music for <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i>, <i>Barbe-Bleue</i>, and
<i>La Vie parisienne</i>.) Other delightful episodes from this operetta are
Helen&rsquo;s invocation with chorus, &ldquo;<i>Amours divins</i>,&rdquo; and her highly lyrical
airs, &ldquo;<i>On me nomme H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Un mari Sage</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>La vrai! je ne suis
pas coupable</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Galop is almost as much a specialty with Offenbach as the Can-Can.
This is a spirited, highly rhythmic dance of German origin introduced
in Paris in 1829. Two of Offenbach&rsquo;s best known Galops appear
respectively in <i>La Grande Duchess de G&eacute;rolstein</i> (1867) and <i>Genevi&egrave;ve
de Brabant</i> (1859).</p>
<p>It is perhaps not generally known that the famous &ldquo;Marine&rsquo;s Hymn&rdquo;
familiar to all Americans as &ldquo;From the Halls of Montezuma&rdquo; also comes
out of <i>Genevi&egrave;ve de Brabant</i>. The Hymn was copyrighted by the
Marine Corps in 1919. It is known that the lyric was written in 1847 by
an unidentified Marine. The melody was taken from one of the airs in
Offenbach&rsquo;s operetta, <i>Genevi&egrave;ve de Brabant</i>.</p>
<p><i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i> (<i>Orph&eacute;e aux enfers</i>) is Offenbach&rsquo;s masterwork,
first produced in Paris on October 21, 1858. This delightful
comic opera, with book by Hector Cr&eacute;mieux and Ludovic Hal&eacute;vy, is
a satire on the Olympian gods in general, and specifically on the legend
of Orpheus and Eurydice. <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i> was not at first
successful since audiences did not seem to find much mirth in a satire
on Olympian gods. But when a powerful French critic, Jules Janin,
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
violently attacked it as a &ldquo;profanation of holy and glorious antiquity,&rdquo;
the curiosity of Parisians was aroused, and the crowds began swarming
into the theater. Suddenly <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i> became a vogue;
it was the thing to see and discuss; its music (particularly the waltzes,
galops, and quadrilles) were everywhere played. The operetta had a
run of 227 performances.</p>
<p>The Overture is a perennial favorite of salon and pop orchestras
throughout the world. It opens briskly, then progresses to the first subject,
a light and gay tune for strings. The heart of the overture is the
second main melody, a sentimental song first heard in solo violin, and
later repeated by full orchestra.</p>
<p>The Can-Can music in <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i> is also famous.
Much of its effect is due to the fact that Offenbach presented the can-can
immediately after a stately minuet in order to emphasize the contrast
between two periods in French history. A contemporary described
this Can-Can music as follows: &ldquo;This famous dance ... has carried
away our entire generation as would a tempestuous whirlwind. Already
the first sounds of the furiously playing instruments seem to indicate
the call to a whole world to awake and plunge into the wild dance.
These rhythms appear to have the intention of shocking all the resigned,
all the defeated, out of their lethargy and, by the physical and
moral upheaval which they arouse, to throw the whole fabric of society
into confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Tales of Hoffmann</i> (<i>Les Contes d&rsquo;Hoffmann</i>) is Offenbach&rsquo;s only
serious opera; but even here we encounter some semi-classical favorites.
This opera, one of the glories of the French lyric theater, was based on
stories by E. T. A. Hoffmann, adapted into a libretto by Jules Barbier
and Michel Carr&eacute;. It concerns the three tragic loves of the poet Hoffmann:
Olympia, a mechanical doll; Giulietta, who is captive to a
magician; and Antonia, a victim of consumption.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Barcarolle&rdquo; from this opera is surely one of the most popular
selections from the world of opera. It opens the second act. Outside
Giulietta&rsquo;s palace in Venice, Hoffmann hears the strains of this music
sung by his friend Nicklausse and Giulietta as they praise the beauty of
the Venetian night. Harp arpeggios suggest the lapping of the Venetian
waters in the canal, providing a soothing background to one of the most
radiant melodies in French music. It is interesting to remark that Offenbach
did not write this melody directly for this opera. He had previously
used it in 1864 as a ghost song for an opera-ballet, <i>Die Rheinnixen</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Two dance episodes from <i>The Tales of Hoffmann</i> are also frequently
performed outside the opera house. One is the infectious waltz which
rises to a dramatic climax in the first act. To this music Hoffmann
dances with the mechanical doll, Olympia, with whom he is in love.
The second is an enchanting little Minuet, used as entr&rsquo;acte music between
the first and second acts.</p>
<p>A collation of some of Offenbach&rsquo;s most famous melodies from various
operettas can be found in <i>La Gaiet&eacute; parisienne</i>, an orchestral suite
adapted from a score by Manuel Rosenthal to a famous contemporary
ballet. This one-act ballet, with choreography by Leonide Massine and
scenario by Comte &Eacute;tienne de Beaumont, was introduced in Monte
Carlo by the Ballet Russe in 1938. The setting is a fashionable Parisian
restaurant of the 19th century; and the dance offers a colorful picture of
Parisian life and mores of that period, climaxed by a stunning Can-Can.
Musical episodes are used from <i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i>, <i>La
P&eacute;richole</i>, <i>La Vie parisienne</i>, and several other Offenbach op&eacute;ra-bouffes.
Beloved Offenbach melodies from various op&eacute;ra-bouffes were adapted
for the score of a Broadway musical produced in 1961, <i>The Happiest
Girl in the World</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c132"><span class="small">Ignace Jan <b id="g_Paderewski">Paderewski</b></span></h2>
<p>Ignace Jan Paderewski, one of the world&rsquo;s foremost
piano virtuosos and one of Poland&rsquo;s most renowned statesmen, was born
in Kuryl&oacute;wka, Podolia, on November 18, 1860. A child prodigy, he was
given piano lessons from his third year on. Several patrons arranged to
send him to the Warsaw Conservatory, from which he was graduated in
1878. Between 1881 and 1883 he studied composition and orchestration
in Berlin, and from 1884 to 1887 piano with Leschetizky in Vienna.
Paderewski&rsquo;s first major success as a pianist came in Vienna in 1889, a
concert that was the beginning of a virtuoso career extending for about
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
half a century and carrying him triumphantly to all parts of the world.
In 1919 he temporarily withdrew from music to become the first Premier
of the Polish Republic, but about a year later he resumed concert
work. He made his American debut in New York in 1891, and his
last American tour took place in 1939. During the early part of World
War II he returned to political activity as President of the Parliament
of the Polish Government in Exile. He died in New York on June 29,
1941. By order of President Roosevelt he was given a state burial in
Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
<p>Paderewski produced many ambitious compositions, some in the
style of Polish folk music; these included the opera <i>Manru</i>, a symphony,
piano concerto, the <i>Polish Fantasy</i> for piano and orchestra and numerous
shorter compositions for the piano. Ironically it is not for one of his
ambitious works that he is most often recalled as a composer, but
through a slight piece: the <i>Minuet</i> in G, or <i>Menuet &agrave; l&rsquo;antique</i>, a graceful,
well-mannered composition in an 18th-century style. This is one of
the three most popular minuets ever written, the other two being by
Mozart and Beethoven. Paderewski originally wrote it for the piano; it
is the first of six pieces collectively entitled <i>Humoresques de concert</i>,
op. 14. Fritz Kreisler transcribed it for violin and piano; Gaspar Cassad&oacute;
for cello and piano. It has, of course, been frequently adapted for
orchestra.</p>
<h2 id="c133"><span class="small">Gabriel <b id="g_Pierne">Piern&eacute;</b></span></h2>
<p>Gabriel Piern&eacute; was born in Metz, France, on August 16,
1863. He attended the Paris Conservatory for eleven years, a pupil of
Massenet and C&eacute;sar Franck. He won numerous awards there including
the Prix de Rome in 1882. After returning from Rome, he succeeded
Franck as organist of the Ste. Clothilde Church in Paris, retaining this
post until 1898. From 1903 until 1932 he was, first the assistant, and
from 1910 on the principal, conductor of the Colonne Orchestra. He
combined his long and fruitful career as conductor with that of composer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
producing a vast library of music in virtually every form, including
operas, oratorios, ballets, symphonic and chamber music. He
achieved renown with the oratorio <i>The Children&rsquo;s Crusade</i> (<i>La Croisade
des enfants</i>), introduced in 1905 and soon after that winner of the
City of Paris Award. Another major success came with the ballet, <i>Cydalise
and the Satyr</i> in 1923. A conservative composer, Piern&eacute; utilized
traditional forms with distinction, and filled them with beautiful
lyricism, well-sounding harmonies, and a poetic speech. In 1925 Piern&eacute;
was elected member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts. He died in
Ploujean, France, on July 17, 1937.</p>
<p>The <i>Entrance of the Little Fauns</i> (<i>Marche des petites faunes</i>) is a
whimsical little march for orchestra from the ballet, <i>Cydalise and the
Satyr</i> (<i>Cydalise et le ch&egrave;vre-pied</i>), introduced at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on
January 15, 1923. A saucy tune for muted trumpet is juxtaposed against
the wail of piccolos; all the while an incisive rhythm is projected not
only by the snare drum and tambourine but also by the violinists tapping
the wood of their bows on the strings. Within the ballet this march
accompanies the appearance of a group of small fauns, led by their
teacher, an old satyr, as they enter school to learn pan pipes.</p>
<p>The <i>March of the Little Lead Soldiers</i> (<i>Marche des petits soldats de
plomb</i>) originated as a piano piece in the <i>Album pour mes petits amis</i>,
op. 14 (1887), but was subsequently orchestrated by the composer. It
opens with a muted trumpet call. A snare drum then establishes the
rhythm and sets the stage for the appearance of the main march melody
in solo flute.</p>
<h2 id="c134"><span class="small">Jean-Robert <b id="g_Planquette">Planquette</b></span></h2>
<p>Jean-Robert Planquette was born in Paris on
July 31, 1848. He attended the Paris Conservatory after which he supported
himself by writing popular songs and chansonettes for Parisian
<i>caf&eacute;-concerts</i>. He started writing operettas in 1874, and achieved world
fame with <i>The Chimes of Normandy</i> in 1877. He wrote many more
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
operettas after that, the most successful being <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> (1882),
<i>Nell Gwynne</i> (1884) and <i>Mam&rsquo;zelle Quat&rsquo;Sous</i> (1897). He died in Paris
on January 28, 1903.</p>
<p><i>The Chimes of Normandy</i> (<i>Les Cloches de Corneville</i>) is one of the
most famous French operettas of all time, and it is still occasionally revived.
Introduced in Paris at the Folies Dramatiques on April 19, 1877,
its success was so immediate and permanent that within a decade it had
been given over a thousand times in Paris alone. It was first seen in
New York in 1877, and in London in 1888, major successes in both
places. The book by Clairville and Gabet presents the life of fishing
and peasant folk in Normandy during the regime of Louis XV. Germaine
is in love with the fisherman, Jean, but finds opposition in her
miserly old uncle, Gaspard, who has other plans for her. To escape her
uncle, Germaine finds employment with Henri, a Marquis, who has
suddenly returned to his native village to take up residence in the family
castle rumored to be haunted. The mystery of the haunted castle is
cleared up when the discovery is made that Gaspard has used it to hide
his gold; and the bells of the castle begin to ring out loud and clear
again. Gaspard, after a brief siege with insanity, is made to sanction the
marriage of Germaine and Jean at a magnificent festival honoring the
Marquis; at the same time it is suddenly uncovered that Germaine is in
reality a Marchioness.</p>
<p>This is an operetta overflowing with ear-caressing melodies. The
most famous are Germaine&rsquo;s bell song, &ldquo;<i>Nous avons, h&eacute;las, perdu d&rsquo;excellence
ma&icirc;tres</i>&rdquo;; the Marquis&rsquo; lilting waltz-rondo, &ldquo;<i>M&ecirc;me sans consulter
mon coeur</i>&rdquo;; and Serpolette&rsquo;s cider song, &ldquo;<i>La Pomme est un fruit
plein de s&egrave;ve</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c135"><span class="small">Eduard <b id="g_Poldini">Poldini</b></span></h2>
<p>Eduard Poldini was born in Budapest, Hungary, on June
13, 1869. His music study took place at the Vienna Conservatory. Poldini
subsequently established his home in Vevey, Switzerland, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
he devoted himself to composition. His most significant works are for
the stage&mdash;both comic and serious operas that include <i>The Vagabond
and the Princess</i> (1903) and <i>The Carnival Marriage</i> (1924). He was
also a prolific composer of salon pieces for the piano, familiar to piano
studies throughout the world. In 1935 Poldini received the Order of
the Hungarian Cross and in 1948 the Hungarian Pro Arte Prize. He
died in Vevey, Switzerland on June 29, 1957.</p>
<p><i>Poup&eacute;e valsante</i> (<i>Dancing Doll</i>) is Poldini&rsquo;s best known composition,
a fleet, graceful melody contrasted by a sentimental counter-subject.
The composer wrote it for solo piano. Fritz Kreisler adapted it for
violin and piano, and Frank La Forge for voice and orchestra. It has
also often been transcribed for orchestra.</p>
<h2 id="c136"><span class="small">Manuel <b id="g_Ponce">Ponce</b></span></h2>
<p>Manuel Maria Ponce was born in Fresnillo, Mexico,
on December 8, 1882. His main music study took place in Europe
where he arrived in 1905: composition with Enrico Bossi in Bologna;
piano with Martin Krause in Berlin. After returning to Mexico he
gave a concert of his own compositions in 1912. For several years he
taught the piano at the National Conservatory in Mexico City, and
from 1917 to 1919 he was the conductor of the National Symphony
Orchestra there. During World War I he lived in Havana and New
York. After the war he went to Paris for an additional period of study
with Paul Dukas. From 1933 to 1938 he was professor of folklore at the
University of Mexico. In 1941 he toured South America, and in 1947
he was the recipient of the first annual Mexican Arts and Sciences
Award established by the President of Mexico. He died in Mexico City
on April 24, 1948.</p>
<p>Ponce was a modernist who filled his orchestral compositions with
the most advanced resources of modern harmony, counterpoint and
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
rhythm. But in his songs he possessed a spontaneous and ingratiating
lyricism, often of a national Mexican identity. It is one of these that has
made him famous in semi-classical literature: &ldquo;<i>Estrellita</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Little Star&rdquo;),
a song with such a strong Spanish personality of melody and rhythm that
it was long believed to be a folk song. Ponce first published it in 1914
but it did not become universally popular until 1923 when it was issued
in a new arrangement (by Frank La Forge) and translated into English.</p>
<h2 id="c137"><span class="small">Amilcare <b id="g_Ponchielli">Ponchielli</b></span></h2>
<p>Amilcare Ponchielli was born in Paderno Fasolaro,
Italy, on August 31, 1834. For nine years he attended the Milan Conservatory
where he wrote an operetta in collaboration with three other
students. Following the termination of his studies, he became organist
in Cremona, and after that a bandmaster in Piacenza. His first opera,
<i>I Promessi sposi</i>, was introduced in Cremona in 1856, but it did not
become successful until sixteen years later when a revised version
helped to open the Teatro dal Verme in Milan. World renown came
to Ponchielli with <i>La Gioconda</i>, first given at La Scala in Milan in 1876.
Though Ponchielli wrote many other operas after that he never again
managed to reach the high artistic level of this masterwork, nor to repeat
its world success. From 1883 until his death he was professor of
composition at the Milan Conservatory. He died in Milan, Italy, on
January 16, 1886.</p>
<p>What is undoubtedly Ponchielli&rsquo;s most famous orchestral composition,
&ldquo;The Dance of the Hours&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Danza della ore</i>&rdquo;) comes from his
masterwork, the opera <i>La Gioconda</i>. This opera&mdash;first performed in
Milan on April 8, 1876&mdash;was based on Victor Hugo&rsquo;s drama, <i>Angelo,
tyran de Padoue</i>, adapted by Arrigo Bo&iuml;to. The setting is 17th century
Venice, and the principal action involves the tragic love triangle of
Alvise, his wife Laura, and her beloved, Enzo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Dance of the Hours&rdquo; comes in the second scene of the third
act. Alvise is entertaining his guests at a sumptuous ball in his palace,
the highlight of which is a magnificent ballet, intended to symbolize
the victory of right over wrong. The dancers in groups of six come out
impersonating the hours of dawn, day, evening, and night. The music
begins with a slight murmur, shimmering sounds passing through the
violins and woodwind. Dawn appears. The music is carried to a dramatic
climax with a strong rhythmic pulse as the day unfolds. When the
music achieves mellowness and tenderness, the softness of evening
touches the stage; and with the coming of night the music acquires a
somber character. At midnight, the music is reduced to a sigh. The harp
presents some arpeggios, and a broad melody unfolds. The mood then
becomes excitable as all the twenty-four hours plunge into a spirited
dance, as light conquers darkness.</p>
<p>The most familiar vocal excerpts from this opera are La Cieca&rsquo;s
romanza from the first act, &ldquo;<i>A te questo rosario</i>&rdquo;; Barnaba&rsquo;s fisherman&rsquo;s
barcarolle (&ldquo;<i>Pescator, affonda l&rsquo;esca</i>&rdquo;) and Enzo&rsquo;s idyll to the beauty of
the night (&ldquo;<i>Cielo e mar</i>&rdquo;) from the second act; and La Gioconda&rsquo;s dramatic
narrative in which she plans to destroy herself (&ldquo;<i>Suicidio</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 id="c138"><span class="small">Cole <b id="g_Porter">Porter</b></span></h2>
<p>Cole Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, on June 9, 1893 to
an immensely wealthy family. Precocious in music, he began studying
the violin when he was six, and at eleven had one of his compositions
published. He pursued his academic studies at the Worcester Academy
in Massachusetts and at Yale; music study took place at the School of
Music at Harvard and subsequently in Paris with Vincent d&rsquo;Indy at the
Schola Cantorum. At Yale he participated in all its musical activities
and wrote two football songs still favorites there, &ldquo;Yale Bull Dog&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bingo Eli Yale.&rdquo; In 1916 he wrote the music for his first Broadway
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
musical comedy, <i>See America First</i>, a failure. During the next few years
he was a member of the French desert troops in North Africa, while
during World War I he taught French gunnery to American troops at
Fontainebleau. Just after the close of the war he contributed some songs
to <i>Hitchy Koo</i> of 1918, and in 1924 five more songs to the <i>Greenwich
Village Follies</i>, both of them Broadway productions. Success first came
in 1928 with his music for <i>Paris</i> which included &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Do It&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Misbehave.&rdquo; For the next quarter of a century and more he was
one of Broadway&rsquo;s most successful composers. His greatest stage hits
came with <i>Fifty Million Frenchmen</i> (1929), <i>The Gay Divorce</i> (1932),
<i>Anything Goes</i> (1934), <i>Leave It to Me</i> (1938), <i>Panama Hattie</i> (1940),
<i>Let&rsquo;s Face It</i> (1941), <i>Kiss Me Kate</i> (1948), <i>Can-Can</i> (1953) and <i>Silk
Stockings</i> (1955). From these and other stage productions came some of
America&rsquo;s best loved popular songs, for which Porter wrote not merely
the music but also the brilliant lyrics: &ldquo;Night and Day,&rdquo; &ldquo;Begin the
Beguine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love for Sale,&rdquo; &ldquo;You Do Something to Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Heart
Belongs to Daddy,&rdquo; and so forth. He was also a significant composer for
motion pictures, his most successful songs for the screen including &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
Got You Under My Skin,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Still of the Night,&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d Be So
Nice to Come Home To,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Fence Me In,&rdquo; and &ldquo;True Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most successful of all the Cole Porter musical comedies was
<i>Kiss Me Kate</i> which began a Broadway run of over one thousand performances
on December 30, 1948, then went on to be a triumph in
Vienna, Austria, where it became the greatest box-office success in the
history of the Volksoper where it was given. In Poland it was the first
American music performed in that country. The text by Bella and
Sam Spewack was based partly on Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>, but it was really a play within a play. A touring company is
performing the Shakespeare comedy in Baltimore, Maryland. The
musical comedy moves freely from scenes of that production to the
backstage complications in the private lives of its principal performers.
In the end, the amatory problems of the two stars are resolved within
a performance of the Shakespeare comedy. This was not only Cole
Porter&rsquo;s most successful musical comedy but also the finest of his scores.
Never before (or since) was he so prolix with song hits in a single production;
never before was his style so varied. The repertory of semi-classical
music has been enriched by a symphonic treatment given the
best of these melodies by Robert Russell Bennett. Bennett&rsquo;s symphonic
presentation of <i>Kiss Me Kate</i> opens with &ldquo;Wunderbar,&rdquo; a tongue-in-cheek
parody of a sentimental Viennese waltz. It continues with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
sprightly measures of &ldquo;Another Openin&rsquo;, Another Show,&rdquo; and after that
come the plangent, purple moods of &ldquo;Were Thine That Special Face,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I Sing of Love,&rdquo; and the show&rsquo;s principal love song, &ldquo;So In Love.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c139"><span class="small">Serge <b id="g_Prokofiev">Prokofiev</b></span></h2>
<p>Serge Prokofiev was born in Sontzovka, Russia, on April
23, 1891. He was extraordinarily precocious in music. After receiving
some training at the piano from his mother, he completed the writing
of an opera by the time he was ten. Preliminary music study took place
with Gli&egrave;re. In his thirteenth year he entered the Moscow Conservatory
where he was a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov and Liadov among others
and from which he was graduated with the Rubinstein Prize for his
first piano concerto. His advanced musical thinking was already evident
in his first major work for orchestra, <i>The Scythian Suite</i>, introduced
in St. Petersburg in 1916. He continued to develop his own
personality, formulating his highly individual style and creative idiosyncrasies
in works like the ballet <i>Chout</i>, the first violin concerto, and
the <i>Classical Symphony</i>, all written during the era of World War I. In
1918 he toured the United States, making his American debut with a
New York piano recital on November 20. While in the United States
he was commissioned to write the opera <i>The Love for Three Oranges</i>
for the Chicago Opera. From 1919 to 1933 Prokofiev made his home in
Paris, but in 1933 he returned to his native land to stay there for the
rest of his life. Though he was honored in the Soviet Union as one of
its great creative figures&mdash;and was the recipient of the Stalin Prize for
his monumental Seventh Piano Sonata inspired by World War II&mdash;he
did not escape censure in 1948 when the Central Committee of the
Communist Party denounced Soviet composers for their partiality towards
experimentation, modernism and cerebralism, in their musical
works. Nevertheless, Prokofiev soon recovered his high estate in Soviet
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
music; in 1951 he received the Stalin Prize again, this time for his
oratorio <i>On Guard for Peace</i> and the symphonic suite, <i>Winter Bonfire</i>.
His sixtieth birthday, that year, was celebrated throughout the country
with concerts and broadcasts. Prokofiev died of a cerebral hemorrhage
in Moscow on March 5, 1953.</p>
<p>Prokofiev was one of the giants of 20th-century music. His seven
symphonies, five piano concertos, nine piano sonatas, the opera <i>War
and Peace</i>, ballets, chamber music, piano compositions and various
shorter orchestral works are among the most significant contributions
made in our time to music. The highly personal way of writing melodies,
his unusual progressions, his harmonic vocabulary are all present
in the few lighter and simpler works with which he made a significant
contribution to the contemporary repertory of semi-classics.</p>
<p>The <i>March</i> so familiar to radio listeners throughout the United
States as the theme music for the program &ldquo;The F.B.I. in Peace and
War&rdquo; comes from the opera <i>The Love for Three Oranges</i> (1921). The
libretto by the composer based on a tale of Carlo Gozzi is a charming
fantasy in which a prince saves himself from death through gloom by
means of laughter, and who then goes at once to rescue a princess from
her prison in an orange. The march occurs in the second act where an
effort is being made to get the Prince to laugh, for which purpose a
festival is being arranged. The march music is played as the court
jester drags the reluctant Prince to these festivities. The quixotic skips
in the melody, the grotesquerie of the musical style, and the pert discords
are all typical of Prokofiev&rsquo;s creative manner.</p>
<p><i>Peter and the Wolf</i>, a &ldquo;symphonic fairy tale&rdquo; for narrator and orchestra
op. 67 (1936) was intended by the composer to teach children the
instruments of the orchestra. But the music is so consistently delightful
for its sprightly lyricism and wit that it has proved a favorite at symphony
and semi-classical concerts. The story here being told is about a
lad named Peter who turns a deaf ear to his grandfather&rsquo;s warning and
goes out into the meadow. There a wolf has frightened, in turn, a cat,
bird, and duck. But Peter is not afraid of him. He captures the wolf,
ties him up with a rope and takes him to the zoo.</p>
<p>The composition opens with the following explanation by the narrator:
&ldquo;Each character in the tale is represented by a different instrument
in the orchestra: the bird by a flute; the duck by an oboe; the
cat by a clarinet in the low register; grandpapa by the bassoon; the wolf
by three French horns; Peter by the string quartet; and the hunter&rsquo;s
rifle shots by the kettledrums and bass drums.&rdquo; Then, as the story of
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
Peter and the wolf unfolds, little melodies appear and reappear, each
identifying some character in the story. Peter&rsquo;s theme is a lyrical folk
song with a puckish personality for strings. Vivid and realistic little
tunes represent the cat, bird, and duck, each tune providing an amusing
insight into the personality of each of these animals.</p>
<p><i>Summer Day</i>, opp. 65a and 65b (1935) is another of the composer&rsquo;s
compositions for children which makes for delightful listening. It
started out as a suite of twelve easy piano pieces for children called
<i>Music for Children</i>. Later on the composer orchestrated seven of these
sections and called the new work <i>Summer Day</i>. In the first movement,
&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; a whimsical little tune is heard in first flute against a contrapuntal
background by other woodwinds, strings, and bass drum.
Midway a secondary melody is given by bassoons, horns and cellos.
&ldquo;Tag,&rdquo; the familiar child&rsquo;s game, is represented in a tripping melody
for violins and flutes; the music grows increasingly rhythmic in the
intermediary section. In the &ldquo;Waltz,&rdquo; a saucy waltz tune with an unusual
syncopated construction is presented by the violins, interrupted
by exclamations from the woodwind with typical Prokofiev octave
leaps. &ldquo;Regrets&rdquo; opens with a tender melody for cellos, but is soon taken
over by oboes, and then the violins. This melody is then varied by
violins and clarinets. &ldquo;March&rdquo; offers the main march melody in clarinets
and oboes. &ldquo;Evening&rdquo; highlights a gentle song by solo flute, soon
joined by the clarinet. As the violins take over the melody the pensive
mood is maintained. The concluding movement, &ldquo;Moonlit Meadows&rdquo;
is dominated by a melody for solo flute.</p>
<h2 id="c140"><span class="small">Giacomo <b id="g_Puccini">Puccini</b></span></h2>
<p>Giacomo Puccini was born in Lucca, Italy, on December
22, 1858, to a family which for several generations had produced professional
musicians. As a boy, Giacomo attended the Istituto Musicale
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
in his native city, played the organ in the local church, and wrote two
choral compositions. A subsidy from Queen Margherita enabled him
to continue his music study at the Milan Conservatory with Bazzini
and Ponchielli. The latter encouraged Puccini to write for the stage.
Puccini&rsquo;s first dramatic work was a one-act opera, <i>Le Villi</i>, given successfully
in Milan in 1884, and soon thereafter performed at La Scala.
On a commission from the publisher, Ricordi, Puccini wrote a second
opera that was a failure. But the third, <i>Manon Lescaut</i>&mdash;introduced in
Turin in 1893&mdash;was a triumph and permanently established Puccini&rsquo;s
fame. He now moved rapidly to a position of first importance in Italian
opera with three successive master-works: <i>La Boh&egrave;me</i> (1896), <i>Tosca</i>
(1900) and <i>Madama Butterfly</i> (1904). Puccini paid his first visit to the
United States in 1907 to supervise the American premi&egrave;re of the last-named
opera; he returned in 1910 to attend the world premi&egrave;re of
<i>The Girl from the Golden West</i> which had been commissioned by the
Metropolitan Opera. Puccini&rsquo;s subsequent operas were: <i>La Rondine</i>
(1917), <i>Il Trittico</i>, a trilogy of three one-act operas (1918), and <i>Turandot</i>
(1924), the last of which was left unfinished but was completed by
Franco Alfano. Operated on for cancer of the throat, in Brussels, Puccini
died of a heart attack in that city on November 29, 1924.</p>
<p>Though Puccini was an exponent of &ldquo;Verismo,&rdquo; a movement in
Italian opera which emphasized everyday subjects treated realistically,
he poured into his operas such a wealth of sentiment, tenderness,
sweetness of lyricism, and elegance of style that their emotional appeal
is universal, and he has become the best loved opera composer of the
20th century. Selections from his three most popular operas are basic
to the repertory of any semi-classical or &ldquo;pop&rdquo; orchestra.</p>
<p><i>La Boh&egrave;me</i> was based on Murger&rsquo;s famous novel, <i>Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de
Boh&egrave;me</i> adapted into an opera libretto by Giacosa and Illica. When
first introduced (Turin, February 1, 1896) the opera encountered an
apathetic audience and hostile critics. It had no big scenes, no telling
climaxes, and most of its effects were too subtle emotionally to have an
instantaneous appeal. But the third performance&mdash;in Palermo in 1896&mdash;received
an ovation. From that time on it never failed to move opera
audiences with its deeply moving pathos and its vivid depiction of the
daily problems and conflicts of a group of Bohemians in mid 19th-century
Paris. The central theme is the love affair of the poet, Rodolfo, and
a seamstress, Mimi. This love was filled with storm and stress, and
ended tragically with Mimi&rsquo;s death of consumption in Rodolfo&rsquo;s attic.
The following are some of the episodes heard most often in potpourris
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
or fantasies of this opera: Rodolfo&rsquo;s celebrated narrative in the first
act, &ldquo;<i>Che gelida manina</i>,&rdquo; in which he tells Mimi about his life as a
poet; Mimi&rsquo;s aria that follows this narrative immediately, &ldquo;<i>Mi chiamano
Mimi</i>,&rdquo; where she tells Rodolfo of her poignant need for flowers and
the warmth of springtime; the first act love duet of Mimi and Rodolfo,
&ldquo;<i>O soave fanciulla</i>&rdquo;; Musetta&rsquo;s coquettish second-act waltz, &ldquo;<i>Quando
m&rsquo;en vo&rsquo; soletta</i>,&rdquo; sung outside Caf&eacute; Momus in the Latin Quarter on
Christmas Eve, informing her admirers (specifically Marcello the
painter), how men are always attracted to her; Rodolfo&rsquo;s poignant recollection
of his one time happiness with Mimi, &ldquo;<i>O, Mimi, tu pi&ugrave;</i>&rdquo; in the
fourth act; and Mimi&rsquo;s death music that ends the opera.</p>
<p><i>Madama Butterfly</i>&mdash;libretto by Illica and Giacosa based on David
Belasco&rsquo;s play of the same name, which in turn came from John
Luther&rsquo;s short story&mdash;was first performed in Milan on February 17,
1904 when it was a fiasco. There was such pandemonium during that
performance that Puccini had to rush on the stage and entreat the audience
to be quiet so that the opera might continue. Undoubtedly, some
of Puccini&rsquo;s enemies had a hand in instigating this scandal, but the
opera itself was not one able to win immediate favor. The exotic setting
of Japan, the unorthodox love affair involving an American sailor and
a geisha girl ending in tragedy for the girl, and the provocatively different
kind of music (sometimes Oriental, sometimes modern) written
to conform to the setting and the characters&mdash;all this was not calculated
to appeal to Italian opera lovers. But three months after the premi&egrave;re
the opera was repeated (with some vital revisions by the composer).
This time neither the play nor the music proved shocking, and the
audience fell under the spell of enchantment which that sensitive opera
cast all about it. From then on, the opera has been a favorite around
the world.</p>
<p>The most celebrated single excerpt from the opera is unquestionably
Madame Butterfly&rsquo;s poignant aria, her expression of belief that her
American lover, so long absent from Japan with his fleet, would some
day return to her: &ldquo;<i>Un bel di</i>.&rdquo; Other popular episodes include the
passionate love music of Madame Butterfly and the American lieutenant
with which the first act ends, &ldquo;<i>Viene la sera</i>&rdquo;; the flower duet of the
second act between Madame Butterfly and her servant in which the
heroine excitedly decorates her home with cherry blossoms upon learning
that her lover is back with his fleet (&ldquo;<i>Scuoti quella fronda di
ciliegio</i>&rdquo;); the American lieutenant&rsquo;s tender farewell to Madame Butterfly
and the scene of their love idyl from the third act (&ldquo;<i>Addio fiorito</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
<i>asil</i>&rdquo;); and Madame Butterfly&rsquo;s tender farewell to her daughter before
committing suicide (&ldquo;<i>Tu, tu piccolo iddio</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p><i>Tosca</i>&mdash;based on the famous French drama of the same name by
Sardou, the libretto by Giacosa and Illica&mdash;was introduced in Rome on
January 14, 1900. It was a blood and thunder drama set in Rome at the
turn of the 19th century; the dramatic episodes involved murder, horror,
suicide, sadism. The heroine, Floria Tosca, is an opera singer in
love with a painter, Mario Cavaradossi; she, in turn, is being pursued
by Scarpia, the chief of police. To save her lover&rsquo;s life, she stands ready
to give herself to Scarpia. The latter, nonetheless, is responsible for
Cavaradossi&rsquo;s execution. Scarpia is murdered by Tosca, who then commits
suicide.</p>
<p>Two tenor arias by Cavaradossi are lyrical highlights of this opera.
The first is &ldquo;<i>Recondita armonia</i>,&rdquo; in the first act, in which the painter
rhapsodizes over the beauty of his beloved Tosca; the second, &ldquo;<i>E lucevan
le stelle</i>,&rdquo; comes in the last act as Cavaradossi prepares himself for
his death by bidding farewell to his memory of Tosca. The third important
aria from this opera is that of Tosca, &ldquo;<i>Vissi d&rsquo;arte</i>,&rdquo; a monologue
in which she reflects on how cruel life had been to one who has
devoted herself always to art, prayer, and love. In addition to these
three arias, the opera score also boasts some wonderful love music, that
of Cavaradossi and Tosca (&ldquo;<i>Non la sospiri la nostra casetta</i>&rdquo;) and the
first act stately church music (&ldquo;<i>Te Deum</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 id="c141"><span class="small">Sergei <b id="g_Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff</b></span></h2>
<p>Sergei Rachmaninoff was born in Oneg, Novgorod,
Russia, on April 1, 1873. He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory
for three years, and his musical training ended at the Moscow Conservatory
in 1892 when he received a gold medal for a one-act opera, <i>Aleko</i>.
In that same year he also wrote the Prelude in C-sharp minor with
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
which he became world famous. His first piano concerto and his first
symphony, however, were dismal failures. In 1901 he scored a triumph
with his Second Piano Concerto which, since then, has been not only
the composer&rsquo;s most celebrated composition in a large form but also
one of the best loved and most frequently performed piano concertos of
the 20th century. Rachmaninoff combined his success as composer with
that as piano virtuoso. Beginning with 1900 he toured the world of
music achieving recognition everywhere as one of the most renowned
concert artists of his generation. The first of his many tours of America
took place in 1909. He also distinguished himself as a conductor, first at
the Bolshoi Theater between 1904 and 1906, and later with the Moscow
Philharmonic. As a composer he enhanced his reputation with a remarkable
second symphony, two more piano concertos, and sundry
works for orchestra. He was a traditionalist who preferred working
within the structures and with the techniques handed down to him
by Tchaikovsky. Like Tchaikovsky whom he admired and emulated,
he wore his heart on his sleeve, ever preferring to make his music the
vehicle for profoundly felt emotions. His broad rhapsodic style makes
his greatest music an ever stirring emotional experience. In 1917 Rachmaninoff
left Russia for good, establishing his permanent home first in
Lucerne, Switzerland, and in 1935 in the United States. All the while
he continued to tour the world as concert pianist. His last years were
spent in Beverly Hills, California, where he died on March 28, 1943.</p>
<p>The Prelude in C-sharp minor, op. 3, no. 2 (1892) is Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s
most popular composition; the transcriptions and adaptations it has received
are of infinite variety. He wrote it when he was nineteen and
instantaneously the piece traveled around the globe. Unfortunately,
the composer never profited commercially from this formidable success,
having sold the composition outright for a pittance. The Prelude opens
in a solemn mood with a theme sounding like the tolling of bells, or
the grim pronouncement by some implacable fate. The second theme
is agitated and restless, but before the composition ends the solemn first
theme recurs. Numerous efforts have been made to provide this dramatic
music with a program, including one which interpreted it in
terms of the burning of Moscow in 1812.</p>
<p>The Prelude in G minor, op. 23, no. 5, for piano (1904), is almost as
famous. The opening subject has the character of a brisk military
march, while the contrasting second theme is nostalgic and reflective.</p>
<p>The <i>Vocalise</i>, op. 34, no. 14 (1912) is one of the composer&rsquo;s best
known vocal compositions. This is a wordless song&mdash;a melody sung only
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
on vowels, a &ldquo;vocalise&rdquo; being actually a vocal exercise. Rachmaninoff
himself transcribed this work for orchestra, a version perhaps better
known than the original vocal one. Many other musicians have made
sundry other transcriptions, including one for piano, and others for
solo instruments and piano.</p>
<h2 id="c142"><span class="small">Joachim <b id="g_Raff">Raff</b></span></h2>
<p>Joseph Joachim Raff was born in Lachen, on the Lake
of Zurich, Switzerland, on May 27, 1822. He was mostly self-taught in
music, while pursuing the career of schoolmaster. Some of his early
compositions were published through Mendelssohn&rsquo;s influence, a development
that finally encouraged Raff to give up schoolteaching and
devote himself completely to music. An intimate association with Liszt
led to the premi&egrave;re of an opera, <i>King Alfred</i>, in Weimar in 1851. In
1863, his symphony, <i>An das Vaterland</i>, received first prize from the
Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. From 1877 until his death he
was director of Hoch&rsquo;s Conservatory in Frankfort, Germany. He died
in that city on June 25, 1882.</p>
<p>A prolific composer of symphonies, concertos, overtures, quartets,
sonatas and sundry other works, Raff was a major figure in the German
Romantic movement, highly regarded by his contemporaries, but
forgotten since his death. Only some of his minor pieces are remembered.
The most popular is the <i>Cavatina</i> in A-flat major, op. 85, no. 3,
for violin and piano, a perennial favorite with violin students and
young violinists, and no less familiar in various orchestral adaptations.
A &ldquo;cavatina&rdquo; is a composition for an instrument with the lyric character
of a song. Raff&rsquo;s broad and expressive melody has an almost religious
stateliness.</p>
<p>Another popular Raff composition in a smaller dimension is the
picturesque piano piece, <i>La Fileuse</i> (<i>The Spinner</i>), op. 157, no. 2, in
which the movement of the spinning wheel is graphically reproduced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<h2 id="c143"><span class="small">Maurice <b id="g_Ravel">Ravel</b></span></h2>
<p>Maurice Ravel was born in Ciboure, France, on March 7,
1875. After studying music with private teachers in Paris he entered the
Paris Conservatory in 1889, remaining there fifteen years, and proving
himself a brilliant (if at times an iconoclastic) student. While still at
the Conservatory his <i>Menuet antique</i> for piano was published, and
<i>Les Sites auriculaires</i> for two pianos was performed. By the time he left
the Conservatory he was already a composer of considerable stature,
having completed two remarkable compositions for the piano&mdash;<i>Pavane
pour une Infante d&eacute;funte</i> and <i>Jeux d&rsquo;eau</i>, both introduced in 1902&mdash;and
an unqualified masterwork, the String Quartet, first performed in
1904. The fact that a composer of such attainments had four times
failed to win the Prix de Rome created such a scandal in Paris that the
director of the Paris Conservatory, Th&eacute;odore Dubois, was compelled to
resign. But Ravel&rsquo;s frustrations from failing to win the Prix de Rome
did not affect the quality of his music. In the succeeding years he produced
a succession of masterworks: the ballet <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, its
premi&egrave;re by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in Paris on June 8, 1912;
the <i>Spanish Rhapsody</i> (<i>Rapsodie espagnole</i>) for orchestra; the suite
<i>Miroirs</i>, for piano. During World War I, Ravel served at the front in
an ambulance corps. After the war, he withdrew to his villa in Montfort
l&rsquo;Amaury where he lived in comparative seclusion, devoted mainly to
creative work. Nevertheless, in 1928, he toured the United States,
making his American debut in Boston with the Boston Symphony on
January 12, 1929; Ravel died in Paris on December 28, 1937, following
an unsuccessful operation on the brain.</p>
<p>One of the most significant of Impressionists after Debussy, Ravel
was the creator of music that is highly sensitive in its moods, elegant in
style, exquisite in detail, and usually endowed with the most stunning
effects of instrumentation, rhythm, and harmony. Some of his best-known
works derive their inspiration and material from Spanish
sources. It is one of these that is probably his most popular orchestral
composition, and one of the most popular of the 20th century, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
<i>Bolero</i>. A &ldquo;bolero&rdquo; is a Spanish dance in &frac34; time accompanied by clicking
castanets. Ravel wrote his <i>Bolero</i> in 1928 as ballet music for Ida
Rubinstein who introduced it in Paris on November 22, 1928. But
<i>Bolero</i> has since then separated itself from the dance to become a concert
hall favorite. When Toscanini directed the American premi&egrave;re in
1929 it created a sensation, and set into motion a wave of popularity for
this exciting music achieved by few contemporary works. It was performed
by every major American orchestra, was heard in theaters and
over radio, was reproduced simultaneously on six different recordings.
It was transcribed for every possible combination of instruments (including
a jazz band); the word &ldquo;Bolero&rdquo; was used as the title of a motion
picture. Such immense appeal is not difficult to explain. The rhythmic
and instrumental virtuosity of this music has an immediate kinaesthetic
effect. The composition derives its immense impact from sonority and
changing orchestral colors. The bolero melody has two sections, the
first heard initially is the flute, then clarinet; the second is given by the
bassoon, and then the clarinet. This two-part melody is repeated
throughout the composition against a compelling rhythm of a side
drum, all the while gradually growing in dynamics and continually
changing its colors chameleon-like through varied instrumentation.
A monumental climax is finally realized, as the bolero melody is proclaimed
by the full orchestra.</p>
<p>Another highly popular Ravel composition has a far different personality&mdash;the
<i>Pavane pour une Infante d&eacute;funte</i> (<i>Pavane for a Dead
Infante</i>). Where the appeal of the <i>Bolero</i> is strong, direct, immediate
and on the surface, that of the Pavane is subtle, elusive, sensitive. A
Pavane is a stately court dance (usually in three sections and in &#8308;/&#8324; time)
popular in France. Ravel&rsquo;s <i>Pavane</i> is an elegy for the death of a Spanish
princess. Ravel wrote this composition for piano (1899) but he later
transcribed it for orchestra. An American popular song was adapted
from this haunting melody in 1939, entitled &ldquo;The Lamp Is Low.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c144"><span class="small">Emil von <b id="g_Reznicek">Rezniček</b></span></h2>
<p>Emil Von Rezniček was born in Vienna, Austria, on May
4, 1860, the son of a princess and an Austrian field marshal. For a time
he studied law, but then devoted himself completely to music study,
mainly at the Leipzig Conservatory. From 1896 to 1899 he was the conductor
of several theater orchestras in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
In 1902 he settled in Berlin where he founded and for several
years conducted an annual series of orchestral concerts. Subsequently
he was the conductor of the Warsaw Opera and from 1909 to 1911 of
the Komische Oper in Berlin. He also pursued a highly successful
career as teacher, principally at the Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin
and from 1920 to 1926 at the Berlin High School of Music. He went
into retirement in 1929, and died in Berlin on August 2, 1945.</p>
<p>Rezniček was the composer of several operas, five symphonies, three
tone poems and various other compositions. His greatest success came
with the comic opera, <i>Donna Diana</i>, introduced in Prague on December
16, 1894, and soon thereafter heard in forty-three European opera
houses. The opera&mdash;libretto by the composer based on a Spanish comedy
by Moreto y Cabana&mdash;is consistently light and frothy. Carlos is in pursuit
of Princess Diana, and to effect her surrender he feigns he is madly
in love with her. Princess Diana plays a game of her own. Coyly she
eludes him after seeming to fall victim to his wiles. In the end they
both discover they are very much in love with each other.</p>
<p>The opera is almost never heard any longer, but the witty overture
is a favorite throughout the world; it is the only piece of music by the
composer that is still often performed today. A sustained introduction
leads into the jolly first theme&mdash;a fast, light little melody that sets the
prevailing mood of frivolity. The heart of the overture is an expressive
melody shared by basses and oboe. It grows in passion and intensity as
other sections of the orchestra develop it. When this melody comes to a
climax, the passionate mood is suddenly dissipated, and the frivolous
first theme of the overture returns to restore a mood of reckless gaiety.</p>

<h2 id="c145"><span class="small">Nikolai <b id="g_RimskyKorsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</b></span></h2>
<p>Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov was born in Tikhvin,
Russia, on March 18, 1844. Trained for a naval career, he was graduated
from the Naval School in St. Petersburg in 1862, after which he
embarked on a two-and-a-half-year cruise as naval officer. From earliest
boyhood he had been passionately interested in music, especially the
folk operas of Glinka and Russian ecclesiastical music. When he was
seventeen, he was encouraged by Balakirev to essay composition. After
returning to Russia in 1864, Rimsky-Korsakov associated himself with
the national Russian school then being realized by Balakirev and Mussorgsky
among others, and completed his first symphony, introduced
in St. Petersburg in 1865. He plunged more deeply into musical activity
after that by completing several ambitious works of national character,
including the <i>Antar Symphony</i> and an opera, <i>The Maid of Pskov</i>. In
1873 he was relieved by the government of all his naval duties and
allowed to devote himself completely to music. At that time the special
post of Inspector of Military Orchestras was created for him. He soon
distinguished himself as a conductor of the Free Music Society in
St. Petersburg and as professor of composition and orchestration at
the St. Petersburg Conservatory. He did not neglect composition, producing
many significant operas and orchestral works. In his music he
remained faithful to national ideals by filling his music with melodies
patterned after Russian folk songs, harmonies derived from the modes
of Russian church music, and rhythms simulating those of Russian folk
dances. To all his writing he brought an extraordinary technical skill
in structure, orchestration and harmony. He died of a heart attack in
Liubensk, Russia, on June 21, 1908.</p>
<p>The exotic personality and harmonic and instrumental brilliance of
Eastern music are often encountered in Rimsky-Korsakov. They are
found in two extremely popular excerpts from his opera <i>Le Coq d&rsquo;or</i>
(<i>The Golden Cockerel</i>): &ldquo;Bridal Procession&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hymn to the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Le Coq d&rsquo;or</i> is a fantasy-opera, introduced in Moscow on October 7,
1909; the libretto, by Vladimir Bielsky, is based on a tale by Pushkin.
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
A golden cockerel with the talent of prophecy is presented to King
Dodon by his astrologer. In time the cockerel accurately prophesies
the doom of both the astrologer and the King.</p>
<p>The oriental, languorous &ldquo;Hymn to the Sun&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Salut &agrave; toi soleil</i>&rdquo;)
appears in the second act, a salute by the beautiful Queen of Shemaka.
After the Queen has captured the love of King Dodon with this song,
they marry. There are many transcriptions of this beautiful melody,
including one for violin and piano by Kreisler and for cello and piano
by Julius Klengel.</p>
<p>The third act of this opera opens with the brilliant music of the
&ldquo;Bridal Procession.&rdquo; The royal entourage passes with pomp and ceremony
through the city accompanied by the cheers of the surrounding
crowds.</p>
<p>In the vital &ldquo;Dance of the Tumblers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dance of the Buffoons&rdquo;
for orchestra, Rimsky-Korsakov skilfully employs folk rhythms. This
dance comes from the composer&rsquo;s folk opera, <i>The Snow Maiden</i> (<i>Snegourochka</i>).
The third act opens with a gay Arcadian festival celebrated
by the Berendey peasants during which this gay and exciting folk dance
is performed.</p>
<p>The pictorial, realistic &ldquo;Flight of the Bumble Bee&rdquo; is an excerpt
from still another of Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s operas, <i>The Legend of Tsar
Saltan</i>. This is an orchestral interlude in the third act describing
tonally, and with remarkable realism, the buzzing course of a bee. This
piece retains its vivid pictorialism even in transcriptions, notably that
for solo piano by Rachmaninoff, and for violin and piano by Arthur
Hartmann.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Hindu Chant&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Song of India&rdquo; is also an operatic excerpt,
this time from <i>Sadko</i>. It appears at the close of the second tableau
of the second act. Sadko is the host to three merchants from foreign
lands. He invites each to tell him about his homeland, one of whom is
a Hindu who proceeds in an Oriental melody to speak of the magic and
mystery of India.</p>
<p>The <i>Russian Easter Overture</i> (<i>La Grand p&acirc;que russe</i>), for orchestra,
op. 36 (1888) was one of the fruits of the composer&rsquo;s lifelong fascination
for Russian church music. The principal thematic material of the overture
comes from a collection of canticles known as the <i>Obikhod</i> from
the Russian Orthodox Church. Two of these canticles are heard in the
solemn introduction, a section which the composer said represented the
&ldquo;Holy Sepulcher that had shone with ineffable light at the moment of
the Resurrection.&rdquo; The first is given loudly by strings and clarinets, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
second quietly by violins and violas accompanied by woodwind, harps,
and pizzicato basses. A brief cadenza for solo violin is the transition to
the main body of the overture where the two canticles from the introduction
are amplified and developed. A brilliant coda leads to the conclusion
of the work where the second of the two melodies is given for
the last time by trombones and strings.</p>
<p>Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s most famous work for orchestra is the symphonic
suite, <i>Scheherazade</i>, op. 35 (1888). Nowhere is his remarkable gift at
pictorial writing, at translating a literary program into tones, more in
evidence than here. This music describes episodes from the <i>Arabian
Nights</i> in four movements which are unified by the recurrence of two
musical motives. The first is that of the Sultan, a forceful, majestic
statement for unison brass, woodwinds and strings; the second is a
tender melody in triplets for strings depicting the lovely Scheherazade.
The Sultan theme opens the first movement, entitled &ldquo;The Sea and
Sinbad&rsquo;s Ship.&rdquo; After quiet chords for the brass, the Scheherazade melody
is heard in solo violin accompanied by harp arpeggios. The music
later becomes highly dramatic as Sinbad&rsquo;s ship, represented by a flute
solo, is buffeted about by an angry sea, the latter portrayed by rapid
arpeggio figures. The poignant Scheherazade motive in solo violin introduces
the second movement, &ldquo;The Tale of the Kalendar.&rdquo; The tale
is spun in a haunting song for bassoon, dramatically contrasted by a
dynamic rhythmic section for full orchestra. The third movement,
&ldquo;The Young Prince and the Princess&rdquo; is a tender love dialogue between
violins and clarinets. After a recall of the Scheherazade melody there
appears the finale: &ldquo;The Festival at Bagdad; The Sea, The Ship
Founders on the Rock.&rdquo; A brief recall of the Sinbad theme brings on an
electrifying picture of a festival in Bagdad. The gay proceedings, however,
are interrupted by a grim shipwreck scene, vividly depicted by the
exciting music. This dramatic episode passes, and the suite ends with a
final statement of the Scheherazade theme.</p>
<p>The <i>Spanish Caprice</i> (<i>Capriccio espagnol</i>), for orchestra, op. 34 (1887)
is one of the composer&rsquo;s rare attempts at exploiting the folk music of a
country other than his own. There are five parts. The first is a morning
song, or &ldquo;Alborada,&rdquo; in which two main subjects of Spanish identity
are given by the full orchestra. This is followed by &ldquo;Variations.&rdquo; A
Spanish melody is here subjected to five brief variations. In the third
part, the Alborada music returns in a changed tonality and orchestration.
The fourth movement is entitled &ldquo;Scene and Gypsy Dance&rdquo; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
consists of five cadenzas. The Capriccio ends with &ldquo;<i>Fandango asturiano</i>,&rdquo;
in which a dance melody for trombones is succeeded by a contrasting
subject in the woodwinds. A last recall of the main Alborada theme
of the first movement brings the work to its conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="c146"><span class="small">Richard <b id="g_Rodgers">Rodgers</b></span></h2>
<p>Richard Rodgers was born in Hammels Station, near
Arverne, Long Island, on June 28, 1902. As a child he began studying
the piano and attending the popular musical theater. He wrote his first
songs in 1916, a score for an amateur musical in 1917, and in 1919
created the music for the Columbia Varsity Show, the first freshman
ever to do so. Meanwhile he had initiated a collaborative arrangement
with the lyricist, Lorenz Hart, that lasted almost a quarter of a century.
Their first song to reach the Broadway theater was &ldquo;Any Old Place
With You&rdquo; in <i>A Lonely Romeo</i> in 1919. Their first Broadway musical
was <i>The Poor Little Ritz Girl</i> in 1920, and their first success came with
<i>The Garrick Gaieties</i> in 1925 where the song, &ldquo;Manhattan,&rdquo; was introduced.
For the next twenty years, Rodgers and Hart&mdash;frequently with
Herbert Fields as librettist&mdash;dominated the musical stage with some of
the most original and freshly conceived musical productions of that
period: <i>Dearest Enemy</i> (1925), <i>The Girl Friend</i> (1926), <i>Peggy-Ann</i>
(1926), <i>A Connecticut Yankee</i> (1927), <i>On Your Toes</i> (1936), <i>Babes in
Arms</i> (1937), <i>I&rsquo;d Rather Be Right</i> (1937), <i>I Married an Angel</i> (1938),
<i>The Boys from Syracuse</i> (1938), and <i>Pal Joey</i> (1940). From these and
other productions came hundreds of songs some of which have since
become classics in American popular music. The best of these were
&ldquo;Here In My Arms,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blue Room,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Heart Stood Still,&rdquo; &ldquo;My
Romance,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Small
Hotel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where or When,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Funny Valentine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spring Is Here,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Falling in Love With Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Could Write a Book&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bewitched,
Bothered and Bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>By Jupiter</i>, in 1942, was the last of the Rodgers and Hart musicals.
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
Hart&rsquo;s physical and moral disintegration made it necessary for Rodgers
to seek out a new collaborator. He found him in Oscar Hammerstein
II, with whom Rodgers embarked on a new and even greater career as
composer for the theater. Their first collaboration was <i>Oklahoma!</i> in
1943, an unprecedented box-office triumph, and a production that
revolutionized the musical stage by crystallizing the concept and procedures
of the musical play as opposed to the musical comedy. After
that Rodgers and Hammerstein brought to the stage such classics as
<i>Carousel</i>, <i>South Pacific</i>, and <i>The King and I</i>. Other Rodgers and Hammerstein
productions were <i>Allegro</i> (1947), <i>Me and Juliet</i> (1953), <i>Pipe
Dream</i> (1955), <i>The Flower Drum Song</i> (1958) and <i>The Sound of
Music</i> (1959). Among the most famous songs by Rodgers from these
productions&mdash;besides those from musical plays discussed below&mdash;were
&ldquo;A Fellow Needs a Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;No Other Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s Got a Home
But Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;All at Once You Love Her,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Enjoy Being a Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do,
Re, Mi,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sound of Music&rdquo; and &ldquo;Climb Every Mountain.&rdquo; The
collaboration of Rodgers and Hammerstein ended in 1960 with the
death of the lyricist.</p>
<p><i>Oklahoma!</i>, <i>Carousel</i>, <i>South Pacific</i>, and <i>The King and I</i> have become
enduring monuments in the American theater. They are continually
revived, have been adapted for motion pictures, and are perpetually
represented at semi-classical concerts and on records. In whatever
form they appear they never fail to excite and inspire audiences.
It is in these productions that Rodgers has reached the highest creative
altitudes of his career, with music of such expressive lyricism, dramatic
impact, consummate technical skill, and pervading charm and grace
that its survival in American music seems assured. Robert Russell Bennett
has made skilful orchestral adaptations of the basic melodic material
from each of these musical plays, and it is most usually these
adaptations that are most frequently performed by pop and semi-classical
orchestras.</p>
<p><i>Carousel</i> is the second of the Rodgers and Hammerstein masterworks,
succeeding <i>Oklahoma!</i> by about two years. It is one of the most
radiant ornaments of our musical stage. Oscar Hammerstein II here
adapted Ferenc Molnar&rsquo;s play, <i>Liliom</i>, with changes in setting, time,
and some basic alterations of plot. In the musical version the action
takes place in New England in 1873. Billy Bigelow, a barker in an
amusement park, falls in love and marries Julie Jordan. A charming
but irresponsible young man, Billy decides to get some money in a
holdup, when he learns his wife is pregnant. Caught, Billy eludes
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
arrest by committing suicide. After a brief stay in Purgatory, Billy is
permitted to return to earth for a single day to achieve redemption, the
price for his admission to Heaven. On earth, he meets his daughter.
Through her love, understanding and forgiveness he achieves his redemption.
Thus the musical ends in a happy glow of love and compassion
whereas Molnar&rsquo;s original play ended on the tragic note of
frustration.</p>
<p><i>Carousel</i> opened in New York on April 19, 1945. John Chapman
described it as &ldquo;one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen, and I
shall remember it always.&rdquo; It received the Drama Critics Award and
eight Donaldson Awards. Since then it has often been revived besides
being adapted for the screen; in 1958 it was presented at the World&rsquo;s
Fair in Brussels.</p>
<p>The heartwarming glow that pervades the play in Hammerstein&rsquo;s
moving dialogue and lyrics was magically caught in the score, which
begins with an extended waltz sequence for orchestra. In the play
this music is heard under the opening scene which represents an
amusement park dominated by a gay carousel. This waltz music is a
self-sufficient composition that can be, and often is, played independently
of the other excerpts. The other main musical episodes include
the love duet of Billy and Julie, &ldquo;If I Loved You&rdquo;; Billy&rsquo;s eloquent and
extended narrative, &ldquo;Soliloquy,&rdquo; when he learns he is about to become
a father; the spiritual &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll Never Walk Alone&rdquo;; the ebullient
&ldquo;June Is Bustin&rsquo; Out All Over&rdquo;; two vigorous choral episodes, &ldquo;Blow
High, Blow Low&rdquo; and &ldquo;This Was a Real Nice Clambake.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The King and I</i>, presented on March 29, 1951, was adapted by Oscar
Hammerstein II from Margaret Landon&rsquo;s novel <i>Anna and the King of
Siam</i> (which had already been made into a successful non-musical motion
picture starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne). Anna, played in
the musical by Gertrude Lawrence, is an English schoolmistress come
to Siam to teach Western culture to the royal princes and princesses.
Her own strong will and Western independence comes into sharp conflict
with the king, an Eastern despot enacted by Yul Brynner. But
they are nonetheless drawn to each other, partly through curiosity,
partly through admiration. Naturally, since they are of different social
stations and cultures, a love interest is out of the question, but they
are ineluctably drawn to each other, particularly after Anna has managed
to save a critical political situation in Siam through her ingenuity.
The king dies just before the final curtain; Anna remains on as a
teacher of the children she has come to love.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Part of the attraction of Rodgers&rsquo; music is its subtle Oriental flavoring.
In the music&mdash;as in text, settings and costuming&mdash;<i>The King and I</i>
is a picture of an &ldquo;East of frank and unashamed romance,&rdquo; as Richard
Watts, Jr., said, &ldquo;seen through the eyes of ... theatrical artists of rare
taste and creative power.&rdquo; The Oriental element is particularly pronounced
in the orchestral excerpt, &ldquo;The March of the Royal Siamese
Children,&rdquo; with its exotic syncopated structure and orchestration. Other
popular excerpts from this score include Anna&rsquo;s lilting &ldquo;I Whistle a
Happy Tune&rdquo;; her poignant ballad &ldquo;Hello, Young Lovers&rdquo;; Anna&rsquo;s
duet with the king, &ldquo;Shall We Dance?&rdquo;; her amiable conversation with
the children, &ldquo;Getting to Know You&rdquo;; the King&rsquo;s narrative, &ldquo;A Puzzlement&rdquo;;
also two sensitive and atmospheric duets by the two Siamese
lovers, Tuptim and Lun Tha, &ldquo;We Kiss in the Shadow&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Have
Dreamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Oklahoma!</i>, the first of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical plays&mdash;which
opened on March 31, 1943&mdash;made stage history. Its run of 2,248
performances was the longest run of any Broadway musical up to then;
a national company toured for ten years. It was successfully produced
in Europe, Africa, and Australia. But beyond being a box-office triumph
of incomparable magnitude, it was also an artistic event of the first
importance. This was musical comedy no more, but a vital folk play
rich in dramatic content, and authentic in characterization and background.
The play upon which it was based was Lynn Riggs&rsquo; folk play,
<i>Green Grow the Lilacs</i>, adapted by Oscar Hammerstein II. In making
his adaptation, Hammerstein had to sidestep long accepted formulas
and clich&eacute;s of the American musical stage to meet the demands of
Riggs&rsquo; play. Chorus-girl routines made way for American ballet conceived
by Agnes De Mille. Set comedy routines were replaced by a
humor which rose naturally from text and characters. Each musical incident
was basic to the movement of the dramatic action. Even the plot
was unorthodox for our musical theater. At the turn of the present
century in West-Indian country, Laurey and Curly are in love, but are
kept apart by their respective diffidence and a false sense of hostility. An
ugly, lecherous character, Jud Fry, pursues Laurey. Laurey and Curly
finally declare their love for each other. At their wedding Jud arrives
inebriated, attacks Curly with a knife, and becomes its fatal victim
when he accidentally falls upon the blade during a brawl. A hastily improvised
trial exonerates Curly of murder and permits him and his
bride to set off on their honeymoon for a land that some day will get the
name of Oklahoma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>The play opens at once with its best musical foot forward, a simple
song, &ldquo;Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; which has the personality of
American folk music. It is sung offstage by Curly. After that the principal
musical episodes include the love song of Curly and Laurey, &ldquo;People
Will Say We&rsquo;re in Love&rdquo;; several songs with a strong American
national identity, including &ldquo;Kansas City,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Farmer and the Cowman,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Surrey With the Fringe on Top,&rdquo; and the title number;
and two highly expressive numbers, &ldquo;Out of My Dreams&rdquo; and &ldquo;Many a
New Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Slaughter on Tenth Avenue</i> is one of Rodgers&rsquo; most famous orchestral
compositions, and one of the finest achievements of the school of
symphonic-jazz writing. This music was used for a ballet sequence in
the Rodgers and Hart musical, <i>On Your Toes</i>, first produced in 1936.
Since <i>On Your Toes</i> dwelled in the world of ballet, with dancers as
principal characters, ballet episodes played an important part in the
unfolding of the story; these episodes were conceived by George Balanchine.
The play reaches a dramatic climax with a jazz ballet, a satire
on gangsters, entitled <i>Slaughter on Tenth Avenue</i>. This is a description
of the pursuit by gangsters of a hoofer and his girl. Caught up in a Tenth
Avenue caf&eacute;, the gangsters murder the girl and are about to kill the
hoofer when the police come to his rescue. Rodgers&rsquo; music for the
ballet is an extended and integrated symphonic-jazz composition which
has won its way into the permanent repertory of semi-classical music.
It is constructed from two main melodic ideas. The first is an impudent
little jazz tune, and the second is a rich and luscious jazz melody for
strings.</p>
<p><i>South Pacific</i>, produced on April 7, 1949, was both commercially and
artistically of the magnitude of <i>Oklahoma!</i> Its Broadway run of 1,925
performances was only 325 less than that of its epoch-making predecessor.
In many other respects <i>South Pacific</i> outdid <i>Oklahoma!</i>: In the
overall box-office grossage; in sale of sheet music and records; in the
capture of prizes (including the Pulitzer Prize for drama, seven Antoinette
Perry and nine Donaldson awards). The book was adapted by
Oscar Hammerstein II and Joshua Logan from <i>Tales of the South
Pacific</i>, a series of short stories about American troops in the Pacific
during World War II. In the adaptation two love plots are emphasized.
The first involves the French planter, Emile de Becque, and the American
ensign, Nellie Forbush; the other engages Liat, a Tonkinese girl,
and Lieutenant Cable. The first ends happily, but only after complications
brought on by the discovery on Nellie&rsquo;s part that Emile was once
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
married to a Polynesian and is the father of two Eurasian children. The
other love affair has a tragic ending, since Lieutenant Cable dies on a
mission. With Ezio Pinza as De Becque and Mary Martin as Nellie,
<i>South Pacific</i> was &ldquo;a show of rare enchantment,&rdquo; as Howard Barnes reported,
&ldquo;novel in texture and treatment, rich in dramatic substance,
and eloquent in song.&rdquo; Among its prominent musical numbers are De
Becque and Nellie&rsquo;s love song, &ldquo;Some Enchanted Evening&rdquo;; De
Becque&rsquo;s lament &ldquo;This Nearly Was Mine&rdquo;; Cable&rsquo;s love song &ldquo;Younger
Than Springtime&rdquo;; three songs by Nellie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Wash That Man
Right Outa My Hair,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Cockeyed Optimist,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Love with
a Wonderful Guy&rdquo;; two exotic numbers by the Tonkinese Bloody Mary,
&ldquo;Happy Talk&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bali Ha&rsquo;i&rdquo;; and a spirited and humorous choral
number by the Marines, &ldquo;There Is Nothing Like a Dame.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Victory at Sea</i> is a nine-movement suite for symphony orchestra
adapted by Robert Russell Bennett from the extended musical score
for a series of documentary films on naval operations during World
War II. These films were presented over NBC television in 1952 and
received both the Sylvania and the George Foster Peabody Awards.
Much of the acclaim accorded to these remarkable films belonged to
Rodgers&rsquo; background music which, as Otis L. Guernsey said, &ldquo;suggested
courage, self-sacrifice and the indomitable spirit of the free man.&rdquo;
A <i>New Yorker</i> critic described Rodgers&rsquo; music as a &ldquo;seemingly endless
creation, now martial, now tender, now tuneful, now dissonant ... memorable
and tremendously moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement, &ldquo;The Song of the High Seas,&rdquo; is a picture of
ships menaced by Nazi U-boats on the seas during the early part of
World War II. They finally get involved in battle. &ldquo;The Pacific Boils
Over&rdquo; describes the beauty of Hawaii at peace in a melody suggesting
Hawaiian song and dance. War comes, and this idyllic mood is shattered.
A broad melody for strings ending in forceful chords tells about
the tragedy of Pearl Harbor and the grim business of repairing the
damage inflicted upon it by the Japanese. The third movement is one
of the most famous in the suite, often performed independently of the
other sections. It is stirring and dramatic march music of symphonic
dimensions entitled &ldquo;Guadalcanal March.&rdquo; This is followed by &ldquo;D
Day,&rdquo; its principal melody a broad, strong subject for brass telling of
the gradual build-up of men and materials for the invasion of Fortress
Europe. The fifth movement, &ldquo;Hard Work and Horseplay&rdquo; provides
the lighter side of war. American soldiers find relief from grim realities
in mischievous escapades and playtime. &ldquo;Theme of the Fast Carrier&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
brings up the picture of a battle scene and ends with moving funeral
music. In &ldquo;Beneath the Southern Cross&rdquo; we get an infectious tango
melody which Rodgers later borrowed for his hit song, &ldquo;No Other
Love,&rdquo; for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical play, <i>Me and Juliet</i>.
&ldquo;Mare Nostrum&rdquo; recalls the harsh realities of war, first by presenting a
serene Mediterranean scene, and then showing how it is torn and violated
by the fierce naval attack on North Africa, Sicily, Salerno, and
Anzio. The suite ends on a note of triumph with &ldquo;Victory at Sea.&rdquo; A
hymn of thanksgiving is sounded. Then we hear reminders of the
&ldquo;Guadalcanal March&rdquo; and the seductive tango melody from &ldquo;Beneath
the Southern Cross.&rdquo; This tango is soon transformed into a rousing
song of joy and triumph with which the suite comes to a magnificent
culmination.</p>
<h2 id="c147"><span class="small">Sigmund <b id="g_Romberg">Romberg</b></span></h2>
<p>Sigmund Romberg was born in Szeged, Hungary, on
July 29, 1887. His boyhood and early manhood were spent in Vienna
where he studied engineering and fulfilled his military service with
the 19th Hungarian Infantry stationed in that city. In Vienna, Romberg&rsquo;s
lifelong interest in and talent for music found a favorable climate.
He heard concerts, haunted the city&rsquo;s leading music salons, was a devotee
of Viennese operettas at the Theater-an-der-Wien. Vienna&rsquo;s influence
led him to abandon all thoughts of becoming an engineer. In
1909 he came to the United States where he led salon orchestras in
various restaurants and published his first popular songs. In 1912 he was
engaged as staff composer for the Shuberts, for whose many and varied
Broadway productions Romberg supplied all the music. Within a three-year
period he wrote the scores for eighteen musicals, one of which was
his first operetta in a European style, <i>The Blue Paradise</i> (1915) for
which he created his first outstanding song hit, &ldquo;<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>.&rdquo;
Though he continued writing music for many musical comedies, revues
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
and extravaganzas&mdash;including some starring Al Jolson at the Winter
Garden&mdash;it was in the field of the operetta that Romberg achieved significance
in American popular music. His musical roots were so deeply
embedded in the soil of Vienna that only in writing music for operettas
in the manner and procedures of Vienna did he succeed in producing
a lyricism that ran the gamut from sweetness and sentimentality to
gaiety, masculine vigor and charm. His most successful operettas, which
are discussed below, have never lost their capacity to enchant audiences
however many times they are revived.</p>
<p>Romberg began writing music for motion pictures in 1930 with
<i>Viennese Nights</i>. Out of one of his many scores for the screen came
the poignant ballad, &ldquo;When I Grow Too Old to Dream.&rdquo; His last huge
success on Broadway was achieved not with an operetta but with an
American musical comedy with American backgrounds, settings and
characters&mdash;and songs in a pronounced American idiom. It was <i>Up in
Central Park</i> in 1945. His last musical comedy was <i>The Girl in Pink
Tights</i> produced on Broadway posthumously in 1954. Romberg died
in New York City on November 9, 1951. Three years after his death
his screen biography, <i>Deep in My Heart</i>, was released, with Jos&eacute; Ferrer
playing the part of the composer.</p>
<p><i>Blossom Time</i> was first produced on Broadway on September 29,
1921 and proved so successful that to meet the demand for tickets a
second company was formed to perform it at a nearby theater. There
were also four national companies running simultaneously. This musical
was derived from the successful German operetta, <i>Das drei Maederlhaus</i>,
adapted by Dorothy Donnelly. The central character is the
beloved Viennese composer of the early 19th century, Franz Schubert,
and the plot is built around the composer&rsquo;s supposed frustrated love for
Mitzi, who, in turn, falls in love with Schubert&rsquo;s best friend. The composer&rsquo;s
anguish in losing her makes it impossible for him to finish the
symphony he was writing for her&mdash;and it remains forever unfinished.
This tragic episode, however, has no basis in biographical fact and is
entirely the figment of a fertile operetta librettist&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>Romberg&rsquo;s most famous songs were all based on Schubert&rsquo;s own
melodies, and one became a hit of major proportions: &ldquo;Song of Love&rdquo;
based on the beautiful main theme from the first movement of the
<i>Unfinished Symphony</i>. Other popular selections include &ldquo;Tell Me
Daisy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lonely Hearts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; and &ldquo;Three Little Maids&rdquo;&mdash;all
possessed of that charm, grace and <i>Gemuetlichkeit</i> which we always
associate with the city of Vienna and its popular music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p><i>The Desert Song</i>, produced on November 30, 1926, had for its background
the colorful setting of French Morocco. There Margot Bonvalet
is in love with the Governor&rsquo;s son but is being pursued by the bandit
chief, The Red Shadow. In the end it turns out that the Governor&rsquo;s son
and The Red Shadow are one and the same person. The principal
musical excerpts include the romantic duet of Margot and The Red
Shadow, &ldquo;Blue Heaven&rdquo;; the rapturous love song of The Red Shadow,
&ldquo;One Alone&rdquo;; and two virile episodes, &ldquo;Sabre Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;French
Marching Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike most Romberg operettas, <i>Maytime</i>, presented on August 16,
1917, did not have a foreign or exotic setting. The action takes place
in Gramercy Park, New York, between 1840 and 1900. However, the
tragic frustrations of the love affair of Ottilie and Richard belong inevitably
in the make-believe world of the operetta. Ottilie is forced to
marry a distant relative. Many years later, Ottilie&rsquo;s granddaughter and
Richard&rsquo;s grandson find each other, fall in love, and fulfil the happiness
denied their grandparents. The most important musical number in this
play is the sweet and sentimental waltz, &ldquo;Will You Remember?&rdquo;, which
is repeated several times during the course of the action. Other numbers
include &ldquo;Jump Jim Crow,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Windy Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dancing Will
Keep You Young.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The New Moon</i>&mdash;which came to Broadway on September 19, 1928&mdash;was
described by its authors (Oscar Hammerstein II, Frank Mandel,
and Laurence Schwab) as a &ldquo;romantic musical comedy.&rdquo; Its hero is a
historical character, Robert Mission, an 18th-century French aristocrat
who has come to New Orleans as a political fugitive. In the operetta
he is a bondservant to Monsieur Beaunoir, with whose daughter,
Marianne, he is in love. When the French police arrive to take him back
to Paris for trial, Marianne boards his ship upon which a mutiny erupts
on the high seas. The victorious bondservants now take possession of a
small island off the coast of Florida where they set up their own government
with Robert as leader, who then takes Marianne as his wife.
This opulent score yields one of Romberg&rsquo;s most beautiful love songs,
&ldquo;Lover Come Back to Me,&rdquo; but it is significant to point out that its
main melody was expropriated by Romberg from a piano piece by
Tchaikovsky. Other delightful musical excerpts from this tuneful
operetta include the tender ballads &ldquo;Softly as in a Morning Sunrise,&rdquo;
&ldquo;One Kiss&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wanting You,&rdquo; and the stirring male chorus, &ldquo;Stout-Hearted
Men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Student Prince</i>, like <i>Blossom Time</i>, was based on a successful
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
German operetta, <i>Old Heidelberg</i>, once again adapted for the American
stage by Dorothy Donnelly. Its first performance took place on
December 2, 1924. It has become one of the best loved operettas of the
American theater; there is hardly a time when it is not revived somewhere
in the United States. The setting is the romantic German University
town of Heidelberg in 1860. Prince Karl Franz falls in love with
Kathie, a waitress at the local inn. Their romance, however, is doomed
to frustration, since the Prince must renounce her to marry a Princess.
Romberg&rsquo;s music is a veritable cornucopia of melodic riches, including
as it does the love duet of Kathie and the Prince, &ldquo;Deep in My Heart,&rdquo;
the Prince&rsquo;s love song &ldquo;Serenade,&rdquo; and with them, &ldquo;Golden Days&rdquo; and
a vibrant male chorus, &ldquo;Drinking Song.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c148"><span class="small">David <b id="g_Rose">Rose</b></span></h2>
<p>David Rose was born in London, England, on June 15, 1910.
His family came to the United States in 1914, settling in Chicago where
Rose received his musical training at the Chicago Musical College.
After working for radio and as pianist of the Ted Fiorito Orchestra,
Rose came to Hollywood in 1938 where he became music director of
the Mutual Broadcasting network. During World War II he served as
musical director of, and composer for, <i>Winged Victory</i>, the Air Corps
production by Moss Hart. After the war, Rose became outstandingly
successful as musical director for leading radio and television programs
(including the first Fred Astaire television show for which he received
an &ldquo;Emmy&rdquo; Award), and as a composer of background music for many
motion pictures. He has also appeared extensively in America and
Europe as guest conductor of symphony orchestras.</p>
<p>Rose is the composer of several instrumental compositions in a popular
style that have achieved considerable popularity. Indeed, it was
with one of these that he first became famous as a composer. This was
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
the <i>Holiday for Strings</i>, written and published in 1943, a three-part
composition in which the flanking sections make effective use of
plucked strings while the middle part is of lyrical character. <i>Holiday for
Strings</i> received over a dozen different recordings and sold several million
records. Fifteen years later, Rose wrote another charming composition
in a similar vein, <i>Holiday for Trombones</i> in which virtuosity
is contrasted with lyricism. Other instrumental works by Rose outstanding
for either melodic or rhythmic interest are <i>Big Ben</i>, <i>Dance
of the Spanish Onion</i>, <i>Escapade</i>, and <i>Our Waltz</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c149"><span class="small">Gioacchino <b id="g_Rossini">Rossini</b></span></h2>
<p>Gioacchino Rossini was born in Pesaro, Italy, on February
29, 1792. He received his musical training at the Liceo Musicale
in Bologna. In 1810 he wrote his first opera, <i>La Cambiale di matrimonio</i>,
produced in Venice. Success came in 1812 with his third opera,
<i>La Pietra del paragone</i>, given at La Scala in Milan. <i>Tancredi</i> and
<i>L&rsquo;Italiana in Algeri</i>, performed in Venice in 1813, further added to his
fame and helped make him an adulated opera composer at the age of
twenty-one. In 1815 Rossini was appointed director of two opera companies
in Naples for which he wrote several successful operas. But his
masterwork, which came during this period, was not written for Naples
but for Rome: <i>The Barber of Seville</i> introduced in the Italian capital
in 1816. In 1822 Rossini visited Vienna where he became the man of
the hour. In 1824 he came to Paris to assume the post of director of
the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Italiens. Among the operas written for Paris was <i>William
Tell</i>, introduced at the Paris Op&eacute;ra in 1829. Though Rossini was
now at the height of his fame and creative power&mdash;and though he lived
another thirty-nine years&mdash;he never wrote another work for the stage.
He continued living in Paris, a dominant figure in its social and cultural
life. His home was the gathering place for the intellectual &eacute;lite of
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
the city, the scene of festive entertainments. He died of a heart attack
in Paris on November 13, 1868.</p>
<p>Rossini was the genius of Italian comic opera (<i>opera buffa</i>). His
melodies are filled with laughter and gaiety; his harmonies and rhythms
sparkle with wit and the joy of life. He was at his best when he brought
to his writing an infallible instinct for comedy, burlesque, and mockery.
But he was also capable of a lyricism filled with poetry and infused
with heartfelt sentiments. He was, moreover, a master of orchestral
effect&mdash;especially in his dramatic use of the extended <i>crescendo</i>&mdash;and
highly skilled in contrasting his moods through rapid alternation of
fast and slow passages. He was also a daring innovator in his instrumentation.</p>
<p>He is a giant in opera, but with his infectious moods and endless
fund of melodies he is also a crowning master in semi-classical music.
His masterwork, <i>The Barber of Seville</i> (<i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>) is as
popular with salon orchestras through its merry overture and main selections
as it is in the opera house. <i>The Barber of Seville</i> is based on two
plays by Beaumarchais, <i>Le Barbier de S&eacute;ville</i> and <i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i>,
adapted by Cesare Sterbini. It is a vivacious comedy in which Count
Almaviva, in love with Rosina (ward of Doctor Bartolo who is in love
with her himself) tries to penetrate Bartolo&rsquo;s household by assuming
various disguises. The Count and Rosina plan to elope, but Rosina
reneges when Bartolo convinces her that the Count is unfaithful to her.
Eventually, Rosina discovers that Bartolo has deceived her. She marries
the Count, and Bartolo finds consolation in the fact that the Count is
willing to renounce Rosina&rsquo;s dowry in his favor.</p>
<p>When this work was first performed in Rome on February 20, 1816
it was a dismal failure. This was largely due to a carefully organized
uproar in the theater by admirers of another famous Italian composer,
Paisiello, who had previously written an opera on the same subject. A
sloppy performance did not help matters either. The furor in the auditorium
was so great that it was impossible at times to hear the singers;
and Rossini was in the end greeted with hisses and catcalls. But the second
performance told a far different story. The singing and staging now
went off much more smoothly, and Rossini&rsquo;s enemies were no longer
present to do their damage. Consequently the opera was acclaimed.
Five years later, a tour of the opera throughout Italy established its
fame and popularity on a solid and permanent basis.</p>
<p>The deservedly famous overture is so much in the carefree and ebullient
spirit of the opera as a whole&mdash;and so felicitously sets the tone for
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
what is soon to follow on the stage&mdash;that it comes as a shock to discover
that it was not written for this work. Rossini had actually created it for
an earlier opera, and then used it several times more for various other
stage works, tragedies as well as comedies. The overture opens with a
slow introduction in which the violins offer a graceful tune. A transition
of four chords leads to the main body in which strings doubled by
the piccolo offer a spicy little melody. The same infectious gaiety is to
be found in the second theme which is first given by oboe and clarinet.
A dramatic crescendo now leads into the development of both themes,
and the overture ends with a vivacious coda.</p>
<p>Besides the overture, some of the principal melodies from this opera
are frequently given in various orchestral potpourris and fantasias:
Count Almaviva&rsquo;s beautiful serenade, &ldquo;<i>Ecco ridente in cielo</i>&rdquo; and
Figaro&rsquo;s patter song, &ldquo;<i>Largo al factotum</i>&rdquo; from the first act; in the second
act, Rosina&rsquo;s coloratura aria, &ldquo;<i>Una voce poco fa</i>&rdquo; and Basilio&rsquo;s denunciation
of slander in &ldquo;<i>La Calunnia</i>&rdquo;; and in the third act, Basilio&rsquo;s
unctuous greeting &ldquo;<i>Pace e gioia sia con voi</i>&rdquo; and Figaro&rsquo;s advice to the
lovers to get married in haste and silence, &ldquo;<i>Zitti, zitti, piano, piano</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>La Gazza ladra</i> (<i>The Thieving Magpie</i>), first produced at La Scala on
May 31, 1817, is also a light comedy; libretto by Giovanni Gherardini,
based on a French play. The central character is a servant girl falsely
accused of having stolen a silver spoon; she is exonerated when the
spoon is found in a magpie&rsquo;s nest just as the girl is about to be punished
at the scaffold. The overture begins with an attention-arresting roll on
the snare drum. This is followed by a brisk, march-like melody for full
orchestra. In the main section, the principal themes consist of a sensitive
little tune for strings and a pert melody for strings and woodwind.</p>
<p><i>L&rsquo;Italiana in Algeri</i> (<i>The Italian Lady in Algiers</i>) is, on the other
hand, a serious opera. It was first produced in Venice on May 22, 1813,
libretto by Angelo Anelli. In Algiers, Lindoro and Isabella are in love,
but their romance is complicated by the fact that Isabella is sought
after by the Mustafa. The lovers manage to effect their escape while
the Mustafa is involved in complicated rites serving as his initiation
into a secret society. The solemn opening of the overture has for its
main thought a beautiful song for oboe. A crescendo then carries the
overture to its principal section in which two lively melodies are heard,
the first for woodwind, and the second for oboe.</p>
<p><i>La Scala di seta</i> (<i>The Silken Ladder</i>) is an opera buffa which had its
first performance in Venice on May 9, 1812. The libretto by Gaetano
Rossi was based on a French farce involving a young girl who tries
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
desperately to keep secret from her jealous guardian her marriage to the
man she loves. A brief and electrifying opening for strings in the overture
brings on a sentimental duet for flute and oboe. Two principal subjects
in the main body of the overture include a gay and sprightly
melody for strings, echoed by oboe, and a tender theme for flute and
clarinet accompanied by strings.</p>
<p><i>Semiramide</i>&mdash;introduced in Venice on February 3, 1823&mdash;is a serious
opera based on Voltaire with libretto by Gaetano Rossi. Semiramis is
the Queen of Babylon who is driven by her love for Asur to murder
her husband. Her later love life is complicated when she discovers that
the object of her passion, a Scythian, is actually her son. Semiramis is
killed by a dagger which Asur directs at her Scythian son; Semiramis&rsquo;
son then murders Asur and assumes the throne. The overture opens
dramatically with a gradual crescendo at the end of which comes a slow
and solemn melody for four horns, soon taken over by woodwind against
plucked strings. A short transition in the woodwind brings on a return
of the opening crescendo measures. We now come to the main part of
the overture in which the first theme is for strings, and the second for
the woodwind.</p>
<p>The most famous of all Rossini&rsquo;s overtures, more celebrated even
than that for <i>The Barber of Seville</i>, is the one for the tragic opera
<i>William Tell</i> (<i>Guillaume Tell</i>). This is perhaps the most popular opera
overture ever written. It is much more than merely the preface to a
stage work but is in itself an elaborate, eloquent tone poem, rich in
dramatic as well as musical interest, and vivid in its pictorial and programmatic
writing.</p>
<p><i>William Tell</i>, which had its premi&egrave;re in Paris on August 3, 1829, is
based on the drama of Friedrich Schiller, the libretto adaptation being
made by &Eacute;tienne de Jouy and Hippolyte Bis. The hero is, of course, the
Swiss patriot who triumphs over the tyrant Gessler and helps bring
about the liberation of his country.</p>
<p>In the early measures of the overture we get a picture of sunrise over
the Swiss mountains, its beautiful melody presented by cellos and
basses. A dramatic episode for full orchestra then depicts an Alpine
storm. When it subsides we get a pastoral scene of rare loveliness evoked
by a poignant Swiss melody on the English horn. Trumpet fanfares then
bring on the stirring march music which, in our time and country, has
been borrowed by radio for the theme melody of &ldquo;The Lone Ranger.&rdquo;
The overture ends triumphantly in telling of William Tell&rsquo;s victory
over tyranny and oppression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>The contemporary British composer, Benjamin Britten, has assembled
various melodies by Rossini into two delightful suites for orchestra.
<i>Soir&eacute;es musicales</i> (1936) is made up of five compositions by Rossini&mdash;from
<i>William Tell</i> and from several pieces from a piano suite entitled
<i>P&eacute;ch&eacute;s de vieillesse</i>. The five movements are marked; I. March; II. Canzonetta;
III. Tyrolese; IV. Bolero; V. Tarantella. <i>Matin&eacute;es musicales</i>
(1941) also gets its material from <i>William Tell</i> and the piano suite.
Here the movements are: I. March; II. Nocturne; III. Waltz; IV. Pantomime;
V. Moto Perpetuo.</p>
<h2 id="c150"><span class="small">Anton <b id="g_Rubinstein">Rubinstein</b></span></h2>
<p>Anton Rubinstein was born in Viakhvatinetz, Russia,
on November 28, 1829. He studied the piano with Alexandre Villoing
after which, in 1839 he came to Paris with his teacher, deeply impressing
Chopin and Liszt with his performances. Between 1841 and 1843
Rubinstein made a concert tour of Europe, but his career as a world-famous
virtuoso did not begin until 1854 when his formidable technique
and musicianship aroused the enthusiasm of Western Europe.
After that he made many tours of the world, his reputation as pianist
second only to that of Liszt; his first American appearance took place
in 1872-1873 when he gave more than two hundred concerts. He also
distinguished himself as conductor of the Russian Musical Society, and
as director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory which he helped found
in 1862. He was one of the most highly honored musicians in Russia
of his generation. He resigned his post as director of the Conservatory
in 1891, and on November 20, 1894 he died in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Rubinstein was an extraordinarily prolific composer, his works including
many operas, symphonies, concertos, overtures, tone poems,
chamber music together with a library of music for solo piano. About
all that has survived from his larger works is his Fourth Piano Concerto
which is flooded with Romantic ardor and is often in the recognizable
style of Mendelssohn. Beyond this concerto, only a few of his smaller
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
pieces for piano are still heard, so delightful in their melodic content
and so charming in mood and atmosphere that they have lost little of
their universal appeal.</p>
<p><i>Kamenoi-Ostrow</i>, though best known as a composition for orchestra,
originated as a piece for the piano. Actually the name <i>Kamenoi-Ostrow</i>
belongs to a suite of twenty-four compositions for solo piano, op. 10.
But the twenty-second number has become so popular independent of
the suite, and in so many different guises, that its original title (&ldquo;<i>R&ecirc;ve
angelique</i>&rdquo;) has virtually been forgotten and it is almost always referred
to now by the name of its suite. Kamenoi-Ostrow is a Russian town in
which the Grand Duchess Helena maintained a summer palace. Rubinstein
was its chamber virtuoso from 1848 on for a few years, and while
there he wrote his piano suite, naming it after the Grand Duchess&rsquo;
residence. The solemn melody and its equally affecting countermelody
have an almost religious character, emphasized in orchestral transcription
by a background of tolling bells. Victor Herbert made an effective
orchestral adaptation.</p>
<p>The <i>Melody in F</i> is one of the most popular piano pieces ever
written. It is found in the first of <i>Two Melodies</i>, for solo piano, op. 3,
but is most often heard in orchestral transcription, or adaptations for
solo instrument and piano. The vernal freshness of its spontaneous
lyricism has made it particularly appropriate describing Springtime;
indeed, verses about Spring have been written for this melody.</p>
<p>The <i>Romance in E-flat major</i> is almost as well known as the <i>Melody
in F</i>. This sentimental melody&mdash;filled with Russian pathos, yearning
and dark brooding&mdash;is the first number in a set of six pieces for solo
piano collectively entitled <i>Soir&eacute;es de St. Petersbourg</i>, op. 44.</p>
<h2 id="c151"><span class="small">Camille <b id="g_SaintSaens">Saint-Sa&euml;ns</b></span></h2>
<p>Camille Saint-sa&euml;ns was born in Paris on October 9,
1835. He was extraordinarily precocious. After some piano instruction
from his aunt he gave a remarkable concert in Paris in his ninth year
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
A comprehensive period of study followed at the Paris Conservatory
where he won several prizes, though never the Prix de Rome. In 1852
he received a prize for <i>Ode &agrave; Sainte C&eacute;cile</i>, and in 1853 the premi&egrave;re
of his first symphony attracted considerable praise. From 1858 to 1877
he was the organist of the Madeleine Church in Paris, a position in
which he achieved renown as a performer on the organ. From 1861 to
1865 he was an eminent teacher of the piano at the &Eacute;cole Niedermeyer,
and in 1871 he helped organize the distinguished Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale in
Paris devoted to the introduction of new music by French composers.
From 1877 his principal activity was composition in which, as in all the
other areas in which he had been engaged, he soon became an outstanding
figure. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in
1868; Officer in 1884; Grand Officer in 1900; and in 1913 the highest
rank in the Legion of Honor, the Grand-Croix. He became a member
of the Institut de France in 1881. Saint-Sa&euml;ns paid his first visit to the
United States in 1906, and made his first tour of South America in 1916
when he was eighty-one. He remained active until the end of his long
life, appearing as pianist and conductor in a Saint-Sa&euml;ns festival in
Greece in 1920, and performing a concert of his own music in Dieppe a
year later. He was vacationing in Algiers when he died there on December
16, 1921.</p>
<p>Though Saint-Sa&euml;ns lived well into the 20th century and was witness
to the radical departures in musical composition taking place all about
him, he remained a conservative to the end of his days. He was, from
a technical point of view, a master. There is no field of musical composition
which he did not cultivate with the most consummate skill and
the best possible taste. He was gifted not merely with a fine lyrical gift
but also at other times with passion, intensity, and a sardonic wit. He
wrote numerous compositions in a light style, but many of his most
serious efforts are readily assimilable at first hearing and readily fall
into the category of semi-classics.</p>
<p><i>The Carnival of Animals</i> (<i>Le Carnaval des animaux</i>), for two pianos
and orchestra (1886) finds the composer in a gay mood. This is witty,
ironic and at times satiric music. The composer regarded the writing
of this work as a lark, thought so little of the composition that he did
not permit a public performance or a publication during his lifetime.
Nevertheless it is one of the composer&rsquo;s most infectious compositions,
one that never fails to enchant audiences young and old. It was described
by the composer as &ldquo;a grand zoological fantasy,&rdquo; and its fourteen sections
represent pictures of various animals. The suite begins with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
march (&ldquo;Introduction and Royal March of the Lion,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;Introduction
et marche royale du lion</i>&rdquo;). After a brief fanfare, sprightly march music
is heard. We can readily guess who is at the head of the parade by the
lion&rsquo;s roar simulated by the orchestra. After this we are given a picture
of a hen through the cackle in piano and strings, and of a cock through
a clarinet call (&ldquo;Hens and Cocks,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Poules et coqs</i>&rdquo;). This is followed
by music for two unaccompanied pianos intended to depict &ldquo;Mules&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>H&eacute;miones</i>&rdquo;). Actually this portion was planned by the composer as a
satire on pianists who insist on playing everything in a strict rhythm
and unchanging dynamics. In the fourth movement, &ldquo;Tortoises&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Tortues</i>&rdquo;),
two amusing quotations are interpolated from Offenbach&rsquo;s
<i>Orpheus in the Underworld</i>. A cumbersome melody in a stately rhythm
then introduces us to the &ldquo;Elephant&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;El&eacute;phant</i>&rdquo;). In this part the
composer&rsquo;s fine feeling for paradox and incongruity asserts itself in contrasting
a ponderous theme with a graceful waltz tune. In the halting
music of the next movement, &ldquo;Kangaroos&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Kangourous</i>&rdquo;), the composer
aims his satirical barbs not on these graceless animals but upon
concert audiences who insist on talking throughout a performance.
&ldquo;Aquarium&rdquo; consists of a sensitive melody for flute and violin against
piano arpeggio figures. In &ldquo;Personages With Long Ears&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Personnages &agrave;
longues oreilles</i>&rdquo;) donkeys are represented by a melody with leaping
intervals. The &ldquo;Cuckoo in the Woods&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Le Coucou au fonds des bois</i>&rdquo;)
consists of a melody for clarinet. &ldquo;Aviary&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Voli&egrave;re</i>&rdquo;) reproduces the
flight and singing of birds. &ldquo;Pianists&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Pianistes</i>&rdquo;), the composer feels,
belongs to the animal kingdom; the attempt by embryo pianists to
master his scales is here described amusingly. &ldquo;Fossils&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Fossiles</i>&rdquo;)
quotes four popular themes from the classics: from Rossini&rsquo;s <i>The
Barber of Seville</i>, Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo; <i>Danse macabre</i>, and two French folk
songs. Satire and wit are replaced by the most sensitive lyricism and
winning sentiment in the thirteenth movement, a section so famous
that it is most often heard apart from the rest of the suite, and in many
different versions and arrangements. This is the movement of &ldquo;The
Swan&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Le Cygne</i>&rdquo;), a beautiful melody for the cello in which the
stately movement of the swan in the water is interpreted. A dance inspired
by this music was made world famous by Anna Pavlova. The
suite ends with the return of all the preceding characters in a section
entitled &ldquo;Finale.&rdquo; In the present-day concert hall, it is sometimes the
practice to present <i>The Carnival of Animals</i> with an appropriate
superimposed commentary in verse by Ogden Nash preceding each
section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p><i>Danse macabre</i>, tone poem for orchestra, op. 40 (1874) is a musical
interpretation of a poem by Henri Cazalis. The composition opens
with a brief sequence in the harp suggesting that the hour of midnight
has struck. Death tunes his violin and almost at once there begins a
demoniac dance, its abandoned theme first presented by the flute. Another
equally frenetic dance tune is given by Death, the xylophone
simulating the rattle of bones. In the midst of the orgy the solemn refrain
of the &ldquo;Dies Irae&rdquo; is sounded. Dawn is announced by the crowing
of a cock. The wild dance dies down and the dancers disappear in the
mist.</p>
<p><i>The Deluge</i> (<i>Le D&eacute;luge</i>), op. 45 (1876), is an orchestral prelude to
a Biblical poem, text by Louis Gillet. The inspiration for this music
comes from a passage in the <i>Genesis</i>: &ldquo;And God repented of having
created the world.&rdquo; Solemn chords preface a fugal passage built from
a theme in violas. After this a beautiful melody for solo violin unfolds
symbolizing humanity in its original state of purity.</p>
<p>The <i>Havanaise</i>, op. 83 (1887) is a popular composition for violin and
piano which makes effective use of a languorous Spanish melody set
against the habanera rhythm. &ldquo;Havanaise&rdquo; is the French term for
&ldquo;Habanera,&rdquo; a popular Spanish dance in slow &sup2;/&#8324; time said to have
originated in Cuba.</p>
<p><i>Henry VIII</i>, an opera, is remembered for its effective ballet music.
The opera, with libretto by Leonce Detroyat and Armand Sylvestre was
first performed at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on March 5, 1883. Since its setting
is England during the Tudor Period, the popular ballet music is restrained,
sensitive and graceful. It is heard in the second act during a
festival given by the King of Richmond to honor the Papal Legate.
Much of the material for these dances was acquired by the composer
from a collection of Scottish and Irish tunes and dances provided him
by the wife of one of his librettists. The Ballet Music is made up of
five sections. The first is a restrained Introduction. Then comes &ldquo;The
Entry of the Clans.&rdquo; This music, it is amusing to remark, is English
rather than Scottish in style because the composer confused the English
Dee with the Scottish river of the same name and decided to use the
English melody &ldquo;The Miller of the Dee.&rdquo; The third movement is a
&ldquo;Scotch Idyll,&rdquo; this time a bright Scottish tune in the oboe. The Ballet
Music continues with a &ldquo;Gypsy Dance&rdquo; in which a Hungarian-type
melody for English horn is followed by brisker music whose main subject
is offered by the violins. The suite concludes with &ldquo;Gigue and
Finale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>The <i>Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso</i>, op. 28 (1863) is for violin
and orchestra. The main theme of the Introduction is found in the
solo violin in the second measure, accompanied by the strings. A forceful
chord for full orchestra brings on the Rondo Capriccioso section,
whose main melody is presented by the solo violin. The solo instrument
later on also introduces a contrasting second theme. After some
embellishment of both ideas, the orchestra loudly interpolates a third
subject which is repeated by the solo violin. All this material is amplified,
often with brilliant virtuoso passages in the violin. A climactic
point is reached when the first theme of the Rondo Capriccioso is pronounced
by the orchestra against broken chords in the violin. This composition
concludes with a coda marked by virtuoso passages for the solo
instrument.</p>
<p>The <i>Marche hero&iuml;que</i>, for orchestra, op. 34 (1871) was originally
written for two solo pianos but later the same year orchestrated by the
composer himself. The composition is dedicated to one of Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo;
friends, the painter Alexandre Regnault, who served in the French
army and was killed during the Franco-Prussian War. This music has
a seven-bar introduction following which the principal march subject
is given by the woodwind accompanied by plucked strings. In the middle
trio section a contrasting theme is offered by the trombone against
an accompanying figure taken from the earlier march melody. The
march music returns in the closing section, but more vigorously than
heretofore. The composition ends with a powerful coda.</p>
<p><i>Le Rouet d&rsquo;Omphale</i> (<i>Omphale&rsquo;s Spinning Wheel</i>), is an orchestral
tone poem, op. 31 (1871), based on an old legend. Hercules is the slave
of the Lydian queen. He disguises himself as a woman and is put to the
task of spinning. The whirr of the spinning wheel is simulated by the
violins at the beginning of the composition. The abused Hercules is
then represented by a somber subject for the bass. Soon the whirr returns
in an increased tempo to point up Hercules&rsquo; return to the business
of spinning.</p>
<p>The composer&rsquo;s most famous opera, <i>Samson and Delilah</i>, is represented
on semi-classical programs with its colorful, exciting <i>Bacchanale</i>.
The opera was first performed in Weimar in 1877, its libretto (by Ferdinand
Lemaire) based on the famous Biblical story. The Bacchanale
comes towards the end of the opera, the second scene of the third act.
At the Temple of Dagon, the Philistines are celebrating their victory
over Samson and the Hebrews with wild revelry in front of a statue of
their god. A part of these festivities consists of a bacchanale to wild
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
music Semitic in melodic content, orgiastic in tone colors, and barbaric
in rhythms. The most celebrated vocal selection from this opera is
Delilah&rsquo;s seductive song to Samson, &ldquo;My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>Mon coeur s&rsquo;ouvre &agrave; ta voix</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The <i>Suite alg&eacute;rienne</i>, for orchestra, op. 60, is a set of four &ldquo;picturesque
impressions of a voyage to Algeria,&rdquo; in the composer&rsquo;s own
description. The opening movement is a prelude. The sea is here depicted
in a swelling figure while brief snatches of melody suggest some
of the sights of Algiers as seen from aboard ship. &ldquo;Moorish Rhapsody&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>Rapsodie mauresque</i>&rdquo;) is made up of three sections. The first and last
are brilliant in sonority and tonal colors, while the middle one is an
Oriental song. &ldquo;An Evening Dream at Blidah&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>R&ecirc;verie du soir</i>&rdquo;) is a
dreamy nocturne picturing a famous Algerian fortress. The most popular
movement of the suite is the last one, a rousing &ldquo;French Military
March&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Marche militaire fran&ccedil;aise</i>&rdquo;)&mdash;vigorous, at times even majestic,
music representing the composer&rsquo;s delight and sense of security in
coming upon a French garrison.</p>
<h2 id="c152"><span class="small">Pablo de <b id="g_Sarasate">Sarasate</b></span></h2>
<p>Pablo de Sarasate was born in Pamplona, Spain, on
March 10, 1844. As a child prodigy violinist he made his debut in Spain
when he was six, and soon thereafter toured the country. In 1859 he
completed with honors a three-year period of violin study at the Paris
Conservatory. He was only fifteen when he initiated a worldwide career
as virtuoso which continued until the end of his life and placed him
with the foremost violinists of his generation. In his concerts he featured
prominently his own arrangements and fantasias of opera arias
as well as his original compositions in all of which he could exhibit his
phenomenal technique. Some of his compositions are now staples in the
violin repertory. They include the <i>Gypsy Airs</i> (<i>Zigeuenerweisen</i>), <i>Caprice
Basque</i>, <i>Jota aragonesa</i>, <i>Zapatadeo</i>, and the <i>Spanish Dances</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>The <i>Gypsy Airs</i> is a fantasia made up of haunting gypsy tunes and
dance rhythms. The heart of the composition comes midway with a sad
gypsy song which finds contrast in the electrifying dance melodies and
rhythms that follow immediately.</p>
<p>Sarasate produced four sets of <i>Spanish Dances</i>, opp. 21, 22, 23, and
26, all for violin and piano. The identifiable Spanish melodies and
rhythms of folk dances are here exploited most effectively. The most
famous of these is the <i>Malague&ntilde;a</i>, a broad and sensual gypsy melody followed
by a rhythmic section in which the clicking of castanets is simulated.</p>
<h2 id="c153"><span class="small">Franz <b id="g_Schubert">Schubert</b></span></h2>
<p>Franz Peter Schubert was born in Vienna, Austria,
on January 31, 1797. He was extraordinarily precocious in music and
was early trained to play the violin, viola and organ. From 1808 to
1813 he attended the Imperial Chapel School where he received a
thorough musical background while preparing to be a chorister in the
Chapel Choir. He showed such remarkable and natural gifts for music
that one of his teachers, the renowned Antonio Salieri, did not hesitate
to call him a &ldquo;genius.&rdquo; When the breaking of his voice compelled him
to leave the school in 1813, Schubert was encouraged by his father, a
schoolmaster, to enter the field of education. For two years, from 1814
on, Schubert taught in the school owned and directed by his father.
During this period he demonstrated phenomenal fertility as a composer
by producing operas, symphonies, masses, sonatas, string quartets, piano
pieces, and almost 150 songs including his first masterpiece, <i>The
Erlking</i> (<i>Der Erlkoenig</i>). After 1817, Schubert devoted himself completely
to composition. He remained singularly productive even though
recognition failed to come. Few of his works were either published or
performed&mdash;and those that were heard proved dismal failures. He managed
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
to survive these difficult years only through the kindness and generosity
of his intimate friends who loved him and were in awe of his
genius. Combined with the frustration in failing to attract public notice
with his music&mdash;and the humiliation of living on the bounty of friends&mdash;was
the further tragedy of sickness brought on by a venereal disease.
A concert of his works in Vienna on March 26, 1828 seemed to promise
a turn in his fortunes. But it came too late. He died in Vienna on
November 19, 1828&mdash;still an unrecognized composer. So completely
obscure was his reputation that for many years some of his crowning
master works lay forgotten and neglected in closets of friends and associates,
none of whom seemed to realize that they were in the possession
of treasures.</p>
<p>Schubert was undoubtedly one of the greatest creators of song the
world has known. His almost five hundred art songs (<i>Lieder</i>) is an inexhaustible
source of some of the most beautiful, most expressive, most
poetic melodies ever put down on paper. He created beauty as easily
as he breathed. The most inspired musical thoughts came to him so
spontaneously that he was always reaching for quill and paper to get
them down&mdash;whether at his home, or at the houses of his friends, in
restaurants, caf&eacute;-houses, and even while walking through the country.
&ldquo;The striking characteristics of Schubert&rsquo;s best songs,&rdquo; wrote Philip
Hale, &ldquo;are spontaneous, haunting melody, a natural birthright mastery
over modulation, a singular good fortune in finding the one inevitable
phrase for the prevailing sentiment of the poem, and in finding the
fitting descriptive figure for salient detail. His best songs have an atmosphere
which cannot be passed unnoticed, which cannot be misunderstood.&rdquo;
But far and beyond his natural gift at lyricism was his genius in
translating the slightest nuances and suggestions of a line of poetry into
tones. It is for this very reason that he is often described as the father of
the <i>Lied</i>, or art song.</p>
<p>Because Schubert&rsquo;s melodies come from the heart and go to the heart
they have been staples in semi-classical literature by way of orchestral
transcription. Thus though they are as lofty and as noble a musical
expression as can be found anywhere, Schubert&rsquo;s songs have such universality
that they are as popular as they are inspired. These are a few
of the Schubert songs that have profited from instrumental adaptations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Am Meer</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;By the Sea&rdquo;), poem by Heinrich Heine. This stately
melody seems to catch some of the vastness and mystery of the sea. This
is the twelfth song from the song cycle <i>Schwanengesang</i> (1828).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>An die Musik</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;To Music&rdquo;), poem by Franz von Schober (1817).
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
The glowing melody has caught the composer&rsquo;s wonder and awe at the
magic of music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Auf dem Wasser zu singen</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;To Be Sung on the Water&rdquo;) poem by
Stolberg. This gay, heartfelt tune expresses the composer&rsquo;s delight in
floating on the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ave Maria</i>,&rdquo; based on a poem by Sir Walter Scott (1825). This is
a melody of exalted spiritual character touched with serenity and radiance.
August Wilhelmj&rsquo;s transcription for violin and piano is a staple in
the violin repertory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Du bist die Ruh&rsquo;</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;You are Peace&rdquo;), poem by Rueckert. An atmosphere
of serenity is magically created by a melody of wondrous beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Der Erlkoenig</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Erlking&rdquo;), poem by Goethe (1815). This is
one of Schubert&rsquo;s most dramatic songs, describing the death of a child
at the hands of the Erlking, symbol of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Die Forelle</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Trout&rdquo;), poem by Schubert (1817). This gay
tune gives a lively picture of a trout leaping happily in and out of the
water. Schubert used this melody for a set of variations in his piano
quintet in A major, op. 114 (1819).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gretchen am Spinnrade</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Marguerite at the Spinning Wheel&rdquo;),
poem by Goethe (1814). Against an accompaniment suggesting the
whirr of the spinning wheel, comes Marguerite&rsquo;s haunting song as she
thinks of her loved one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, Hark, the Lark&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Horch, Horch, die Lerch</i>&rdquo;), poem by
Shakespeare (1826). The melody reflects the light-hearted mood of the
famous Shakespeare verse from <i>Cymbeline</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Der Lindenbaum</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Linden Tree&rdquo;), poem by Mueller is a
poignant poem of unhappy love. It is the fifth song in the cycle <i>Die
Winterreise</i> (1827).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Staendchen</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Serenade&rdquo;), poem by Rellstab. This is probably one
of the most famous love songs ever written. It is the fourth song in the
cycle <i>Schwanengesang</i> (1828).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Der Tod und das Maedchen</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Death and the Maiden&rdquo;), poem by
Claudius (1817). This dramatic song consists of a dialogue between a
young girl and Death, the words of death appearing in a solemn melody
while that of the girl in a breathless entreaty. Schubert used this melody
for a set of variations in his string quartet in D minor (1824).</p>
<p>Like Beethoven and Mozart Schubert wrote a considerable amount
of popular dance music for solo piano, and also for orchestra: German
Dances, Laendler, and Waltzes. All have a vigorous peasant rhythm and
with melodies reminiscent of Austrian folk music. Schubert&rsquo;s waltzes
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
are of particular interest since he was one of the first composers to
unite several different waltz tunes into a single integrated composition.
The Schubert waltzes, each a delight, are found in <i>Valses sentimentales</i>,
op. 50 (1825) and <i>Valses nobles</i>, op. 77 (1827). Liszt adapted nine of the
more popular of these waltz melodies in <i>Soir&eacute;es de Vienne</i> for solo
piano. The 20th-century French Impressionist composer, Maurice
Ravel, was inspired by these Schubert waltzes to write in 1910 the
<i>Valses nobles et sentimentales</i> in two versions, for solo piano, and for
orchestra.</p>
<p><i>Marche militaire</i> (<i>Militaermarsch</i>) is a popular little march in D
major originally for piano four hands, the first of a set of three marches
gathered in op. 41. This is one of Schubert&rsquo;s most popular instrumental
numbers. Karl Tausig transcribed it for solo piano, and it has received
many other adaptations including several for orchestra, in which form
it is undoubtedly best known.</p>
<p><i>Moment Musical</i> is a brief composition for the piano. It is in song
form and of an improvisational character, and is a <i>genre</i> of instrumental
composition created and made famous by Schubert. He wrote many
such pieces, but the one always considered when this form is designated
is No. 3 in F minor, a graceful and lovable melody, the very essence of
Viennese <i>Gemuetlichkeit</i>, although it is subtitled &ldquo;Russian Air&rdquo; (<i>Air
Russe</i>). Fritz Kreisler transcribed it for violin and piano and it is, to be
sure, familiar in orchestral adaptations including one by Stokowski, as
well as versions for cello and piano, string quartet, clarinet quartet, four
pianos, and so forth.</p>
<p>The incidental music to <i>Rosamunde</i> (1823) includes an often played
overture and another of Schubert&rsquo;s universally loved instrumental numbers,
the <i>Ballet Music</i>. When <i>Rosamunde</i> was introduced in Vienna on
December 20, 1823 it was a failure, but this was due more to the insipid
play of Helmina von Ch&eacute;zy than to Schubert&rsquo;s music. The overture
heard upon that occasion is not the overture now known as <i>Rosamunde</i>.
The latter is one which Schubert had written for an earlier
operetta, <i>Die Zauberharfe</i>. A dignified introduction is dominated by
a soaring melody for oboe and clarinet. The tempo changes, and a brisk
little melody is given by the violins; a contrast is offered by a lyric subject
for the woodwind.</p>
<p>The Entr&rsquo;acte No. 2 in B-flat major from <i>Rosamunde</i> is one of
Schubert&rsquo;s most inspired melodies, whose beauty tempted H. L.
Mencken once to point to it as the proof that God existed. Schubert
himself was fond of the melody for he used it twice more, in his String
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
Quartet in A minor (1824) and for a piano Impromptu in B-flat major
(1827).</p>
<p>There are two musical episodes in <i>Rosamunde</i> designated as <i>Ballet
Music</i>. The famous one is the second in G major, a melody so sparkling,
infectious and graceful&mdash;and so full of the joy of life&mdash;that once again
like the <i>Moment Musical</i> in F minor it embodies the best of what today
we characterize as Viennese. Fritz Kreisler&rsquo;s transcription for violin
and piano is famous.</p>
<h2 id="c154"><span class="small">Robert <b id="g_Schumann">Schumann</b></span></h2>
<p>Robert Schumann was born in Zwickau, Germany, on
June 8, 1810. Though he demonstrated an unusual gift for music from
earliest childhood he was directed by his father to law. While attending
the Leipzig Conservatory in 1828 he studied the piano with Friedrich
Wieck. In 1829, in Heidelberg, where he had come to continue his law
study, he completed the first of his works to get published, the <i>Abegg
Variations</i> for piano. He returned to Leipzig in 1829, having come to
the decision to make music and not law his lifework, and plunged intensively
into study. His ambition was to become a great virtuoso of
the piano. In his efforts to master his technique he so abused his hands
that a slight paralysis set in, putting to rest all hopes of a career as
pianist. He now decided on composition. After an additional period of
study with Heinrich Dorn, he completed his first major work, the
<i>Paganini Etudes</i> for piano, and started work on his first symphony. He
became active in the musical life of Leipzig by helping found and editing
the <i>Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik</i>, which became a powerful medium
for fighting for the highest ideals in music. He also formed a musical
society called the <i>Davidsbuendler</i> made up of idealistic young musicians
who attacked false values and philistinism in music. All the while
his creative life was unfolding richly. He wrote two unqualified masterworks
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
for piano between 1833 and 1835, the <i>Carnaval</i> and the <i>&Eacute;tudes
symphoniques</i>. In 1840 Schumann married Clara Wieck, daughter of
his one-time piano teacher. Their love affair had been of more than
five years&rsquo; duration, but Clara&rsquo;s father was stubbornly opposed to their
marriage and put every possible obstacle in their way. Schumann finally
had to seek the sanction of the law courts before his marriage could be
consummated. He now entered upon his most productive period as
composer, completing four symphonies, three string quartets, a piano
quartet, numerous songs, a piano concerto among other works. In
1843, he helped found the Leipzig Conservatory where for a while he
taught the piano, and between 1850 and 1853 he was municipal music
director for the city of Duesseldorf. After 1853 there took place a startling
deterioration of his nervous system, bringing on melancholia,
lapses of memory, and finally insanity. The last two years of his life
were spent in an asylum at Endenich, Germany, where he died on July
29, 1856.</p>
<p>Schumann was a giant in German Romantic music. His works
abound with the most captivating lyricism, heartfelt emotion, subtle
moods, and an unrestricted imagination. There is not much in this
wonderful literature that falls naturally within the category of semi-classics&mdash;only
three piano pieces familiar in transcriptions, and a song.</p>
<p><i>Abendlied</i> (<i>Evening Song</i>), a gentle mood picture in the composer&rsquo;s
most rewarding Romantic vein, comes from <i>Twelve Four-Hand Pieces
for Younger and Older Children</i>, op. 85 (1849) where it is the final
number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Die beiden Grenadiere</i>&rdquo; (<i>The Two Grenadiers</i>) op. 49, no. 1 (1840)
is probably the most familiar of Schumann&rsquo;s many songs. The poem is
by Heine. The music describes with telling effect the reaction of two
French grenadiers on learning that their Emperor Napoleon has been
captured. The song reaches a powerful climax with a quotation from
the <i>Marseillaise</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Traeumerei</i> (<i>Dreaming</i>) is the seventh number in a set of thirteen
piano pieces collectively entitled <i>Scenes from Childhood</i> (<i>Kinderscenen</i>),
op. 15, (1838). Like the <i>Abendlied</i>, it is an atmospheric piece,
perhaps one of the most popular compositions by Schumann.</p>
<p><i>Wild Horseman</i> (<i>Wilder Reiter</i>) can be found in the <i>Album for
the Young</i> (<i>Album fuer die Jugend</i>), op. 68, no. 3 (1848). It was made
into an American popular song in the early 1950&rsquo;s by Johnny Burke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<h2 id="c155"><span class="small">Cyril <b id="g_Scott">Scott</b></span></h2>
<p>Cyril Meir Scott was born in Oxton, England, on September
27, 1879. His musical training took place at Hoch&rsquo;s Conservatory
in Frankfort, Germany, and privately with Ivan Knorr. He went
to live in Liverpool in 1898 where he taught piano and devoted himself
to composition. Performances of several orchestral and chamber-music
works at the turn of the century helped establish his reputation. He also
distinguished himself as a concert pianist with performances throughout
Europe and a tour of America in 1921. Though frequently a composer
with <i>avant-garde</i> tendencies&mdash;one of the first English composers
to use the most advanced techniques of modern music&mdash;Scott is most
famous for his short pieces for the piano which have been extensively
performed in transcription. His writing is mainly impressionistic, with
a subtle feeling for sensitive atmosphere and moods. The best of these
miniatures, each a delicate tone picture, are: <i>Danse n&egrave;gre</i> (<i>Negro
Dance</i>), op. 58, no. 3 (1908); and <i>Lotus Land</i>, op. 47, no. 1 (1905). The
latter was transcribed for violin and piano by Kreisler and for orchestra
by Kostelanetz.</p>
<h2 id="c156"><span class="small">Jean <b id="g_Sibelius">Sibelius</b></span></h2>
<p>Jean Sibelius was born in Tavastehus, Finland, on December
8, 1865. Though he early revealed a pronounced gift for music he
planned a career in law. After a year at the University of Helsinki he
finally decided upon music. From 1886 to 1889 he attended the Helsinki
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
Conservatory where one of his teachers was Ferruccio Busoni,
after which he studied in Berlin with Albert Becker and in Vienna with
Robert Fuchs and Karl Goldmark. He was back in his native land in
1891, and one year after that conducted in Helsinki the premi&egrave;re of his
first work in a national style, <i>Kullervo</i>. From then on, he continued
producing works with a pronounced national identity with which he
became not only one of Finland&rsquo;s leading creative figures in music but
also its prime musical spokesman. In 1897 he was given the first government
grant ever bestowed on a musician which enabled him to give
up his teaching activities for composition. He now produced some of
his greatest music, including most of his symphonies. In 1914 he paid
his only visit to the United States, directing a concert of his works in
Norfolk, Connecticut. After World War I, he toured Europe several
times. Then from 1924 on he lived in comparative seclusion at his home
in J&auml;rvenp&auml;&auml;, which attracted admirers from all parts of the world.
Sibelius wrote nothing after 1929, but by then his place in the world&rsquo;s
music was secure as one of the foremost symphonists since Brahms. In
Finland he assumed the status of a national hero. He died at his home
in J&auml;rvenp&auml;&auml; on September 20, 1957.</p>
<p>Some of the compositions by Sibelius enjoying popularity as semi-classics
are in the post-Romantic German style which he had assumed
early in his career; only one or two are in the national idiom for which
he is so famous.</p>
<p>In the former category belongs a slight, sentimental piece called
<i>Canzonetta</i>, for string orchestra, op. 62a (1911). As its name implies it
is a small and simple instrumental song for muted strings, deeply emotional
in feeling, at times with deeply somber colorations.</p>
<p><i>Finlandia</i>, for symphony orchestra, op. 26 (1900) is one of Sibelius&rsquo;
earliest national compositions, and to this day it is the most famous.
Both in and out of Finland this music is as much an eloquent voice for
its country as its national anthem. One can go even further and say
that more people in the world know the melodies of <i>Finlandia</i> than
the Finnish anthem. So stirring are its themes, so identifiably Finnish
in personality and color, that for a long time it was believed Sibelius
had utilized national folk tunes; but the music is entirely Sibelius&rsquo;. It
opens with a proud exclamation in the brass. After this comes a sensitive
melody for the woodwind, and a prayer-like song for the strings.
The music now enters a dramatic phase with stormy passages. But there
soon arrives the most famous melody in the entire work, a beautiful
supplication sounded first by the woodwind and then by the strings.
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
A forceful climax ensues with a strong statement which seems to be
speaking in loud and ringing tones of the determination of the people
to stay free.</p>
<p>Performances of <i>Finlandia</i> played a prominent role in the political
history of Finland. When performed in its first version, in 1899, it was
used to help raise funds for a Press Pension fight against the suppression
of free speech and press by the Russians. Within the next two years
(following a radical revision of the music in 1900) the work was given
under various titles: In France it was first performed as <i>Suomi</i> and then
as <i>La Patrie</i>; in Germany, as <i>Vaterland</i>. In Finland the music proved so
inflammatory in arousing national ardor that Russia suppressed its performances
in that country, while permitting it to be played in the Empire
so long as the title <i>Impromptu</i> was used. When, in 1905, Russia
made far-reaching political concessions to Finland, Sibelius&rsquo; tone poem
was once again permitted performances. For the next twelve years it became
the national expression of a people stubbornly fighting for its
independence. Performances kept alive the national fire to such an
extent that it has been said that they did more to promote the cause of
Finland&rsquo;s freedom than all the propaganda of speeches and pamphlets.</p>
<p>When the Soviets invaded Finland in the first stages of World War II,
<i>Finlandia</i> once again acquired political importance. In the free world,
particularly in the United States, the music was used to speak for the
spirit of a people refusing to accept oppression and defeat.</p>
<p>Another piece of stirring national music that has become a lighter
classic comes out of the <i>Karelia Suite</i> for orchestra, op. 11 (1893), the
<i>Alla Marcia</i> section. This work was written for a historical pageant presented
by the students of Viborg University and consists of an overture,
two melodious sections (<i>Intermezzo</i> and <i>Ballade</i>) and the <i>Alla marcia</i>,
march music of dramatic surge and sweep, in which effective use is
made of abrupt key changes.</p>
<p>Sibelius wrote several delightful <i>Romances</i> in the German-Romantic
idiom of his early <i>Canzonetta</i>. One of these was originally for solo
piano, in D-flat major, op. 24, no. 9 (1903); another for violin and
piano, F major, op. 78, no. 2 (1915). The former has become popular in
transcriptions for salon orchestra; the latter, for violin and orchestra,
and cello and piano. Perhaps the most famous of Sibelius&rsquo; <i>Romances</i> is
that in C major, for string orchestra, Op. 42 (1903). It begins with an
unorthodox opening, unusual in harmonic structure and varied in inflections,
but its principal melody&mdash;a soulful song&mdash;is in the traditional
idiom of an uninhibited Romanticist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>The best known of Sibelius&rsquo; Romantic compositions, a universal
favorite with salon orchestras, is the <i>Valse Triste</i>, for orchestra, op. 44
(1903). This is a section from the incidental music for <i>Kuolema</i>, a play
by Sibelius&rsquo; brother-in-law, Arvid Jaernefelt; but it is the only one
from this score to get published. This slow and lugubrious melody,
bathed in sentimentality, is a literal musical interpretation of the following
program, translated by Rosa Newmarch: &ldquo;It is night. The son who
has been watching by the bedside of his sick mother has fallen asleep
from sheer weariness. Gradually a ruddy light is reflected through the
room; there is a sound of distant music; the glow and the music steal
nearer until the strains of a valse melody float distinctly to our ears. The
sleeping mother awakens, rises from her bed, and, in her long white
garment which takes the semblance of a ball dress, begins to move
slowly and silently to and fro. She waves her hands and beckons in time
to the music, as though she were summoning a crowd of invisible guests.
And now they appear, these strange visionary couples, turning and
gliding to an unearthly valse rhythm. The dying woman mingles with
the dancers, she strives to make them look into her eyes, but the shadowy
guests one and all avoid her glance. Then she seems to sink exhausted
on her couch, and the music breaks off. But presently she
gathers all her strength and invokes the dance once again with more
energetic gestures than before. Back come the shadowy dancers, gyrating
in a wild, mad rhythm. The weird gaiety reaches a climax; there is
a knock at the door, which flies wide open; the mother utters a despairing
cry; the spectral guests vanish; the music dies away. Death stands
on the threshold.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c157"><span class="small">Christian <b id="g_Sinding">Sinding</b></span></h2>
<p>Christian Sinding was born in Kongsberg, Norway,
on January 11, 1856. After attending the Leipzig Conservatory from
1877 to 1881 he settled in Oslo as a teacher of the piano. His first published
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
composition was a piano quintet in 1884, and in 1885 he directed
a concert of his own music in Oslo. Though he wrote in large forms,
including symphonies, concertos, suites, tone poems and various chamber-music
compositions, he is best known for his smaller pieces for the
piano. In 1890 he received an annual subsidy from his government to
enable him to devote himself completely to composition. One of Norway&rsquo;s
most significant composers, he was given a handsome life pension
in 1915, and in 1916 an additional government gift of 30,000 crowns. In
1921-1922 he visited the United States when he served for one season
as a member of the faculty of the Eastman School of Music. He died in
Oslo on December 3, 1941.</p>
<p>His smaller pieces for the piano include etudes, waltzes, caprices, intermezzos
and various descriptive compositions. It is by one of the last
that he is most often remembered, a favorite of young pianists throughout
the world, and of salon and pop orchestras in instrumental adaptations.
This is the ever-popular <i>Rustle of Spring</i> (<i>Fruehlingsrauschen</i>),
probably the most popular piece of music describing the vernal season.
This is the second of <i>Six Pieces</i>, for solo piano, Op. 32 (1896). The rustle
can be found in the accompaniment, against which moves a soft, sentimental
song filled with all the magic of Nature&rsquo;s rebirth at springtime.
In this same suite, a second number of markedly contrasting nature, has
also become familiar&mdash;the first number, played in a vigorous and picaresque
style, the <i>Marche grotesque</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c158"><span class="small">Leone <b id="g_Sinigaglia">Sinigaglia</b></span></h2>
<p>Leone Sinigaglia was born in Turin, Italy, on August
14, 1868. His preliminary music study took place at the Liceo Musicale
of his native city and was completed with Mandyczewski in Vienna and
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k in Prague. The latter encouraged him to write music in a
national Italian idiom. It was in this style that he created his earliest
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
significant compositions, the first being <i>Danze piemontesi</i>, introduced
in Turin in 1905, Toscanini conducting. Later works included <i>Rapsodia
piemontese</i> for violin and orchestra; <i>Piemonte</i>, for orchestra; a
violin concerto; and various works for chamber music groups, solo instruments
and orchestra. He died in Turin on May 16, 1944.</p>
<p>His best known and most frequently played composition is a gay,
infectious little concert overture, <i>Le Baruffe chiozzotte</i> (<i>The Quarrels
of the People of Chiozzo)</i>, op. 32 (1907). It was inspired by the Goldoni
comedy of the same name which offers an amusing picture of life in the
little town of Chiozzo. There Lucietto and Tita are in love, quarrel,
and become reconciled through the ministrations of the magistrate. A
loud theme for full orchestra provides the overture with a boisterous
beginning. A passing tender thought then comes as contrast. After some
elaboration of these ideas, a delightful folk song is heard first in the
oboe, and then in violins. The tempo now quickens, the mood becomes
restless, and the music grows sprightly. An amusing little episode now
appears in woodwind and violins after which the folk song and the
loud opening theme are recalled.</p>
<p><i>Piemonte</i>, a suite for orchestra, op. 36 is a charming four-movement
composition in which the folk melodies and dances of Piedmont are
prominently used. The first movement, &ldquo;Over Woods and Fields,&rdquo;
opens with a folk tune, which the composer repeats in the finale. Two
other delightful ideas follow: the first in the horn, repeated by the
cellos; the second in muted first violins. In the second movement, &ldquo;A
Rustic Dance,&rdquo; the principal Piedmont dance tune is heard in solo
violin and oboe; a second subject occurs after the development of the
first in lower strings and woodwind. The heart of the third movement,
&ldquo;In the Sacred Mountain,&rdquo; is a folk song first offered by the horns,
accompanied by cellos and double basses. The suite ends with a picture
of a festival, &ldquo;Piedmontese Carnival,&rdquo; its two vigorous ideas heard respectively
in full orchestra, and in trumpet and first violins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<h2 id="c159"><span class="small">Bed&#345;ich <b id="g_Smetana">Smetana</b></span></h2>
<p>Bed&#345;ich Smetana was born in Leitomischl, Bohemia, on
March 2, 1824. Though he was interested in music from childhood on,
he received little training until his nineteenth year when he came to
Prague and studied with Josef Proksch. For several years after the completion
of his music study he worked as teacher of music for Count Leopold
Thun. He soon became active in the musical life of his country;
in 1848 he was a significant force in the creation of Prague&rsquo;s first music
school. In 1849, Smetana was appointed pianist to Ferdinand I, the
former Emperor of Austria residing in Prague. From 1856 to 1861
Smetana lived in Gothenburg, Sweden, where he was active as conductor,
teacher, and pianist. After returning to his native land in 1861 he
became one of its dominant musical figures. He served as director of the
music school, conducted a chorus, wrote music criticisms, founded and
directed a drama school, and organized the Society of Artists. He also
wrote a succession of major works in which the cause of Bohemian
nationalism was espoused so vigorously and imaginatively that Smetana
has since become recognized as the father of Bohemian national music.
His most significant works are the folk opera, <i>The Bartered Bride</i>, and
a cycle of orchestral tone poems collectively entitled <i>My Country</i> (<i>M&aacute;
Vlast</i>). Smetana was stricken by deafness in 1874, despite which he continued
creating important works, among them being operas and an
autobiographical string quartet called <i>From My Life</i> (<i>Aus meinem
Leben</i>). Total deafness was supplemented by insanity in 1883 which
necessitated confinement in an asylum in Prague where he died on
May 12, 1884.</p>
<p>The rich folk melodies and pulsating folk rhythms of native dance
music overflow in Smetana&rsquo;s music, providing it with much of its
vitality and popular interest. Smetana&rsquo;s gift at writing music in the
style, idiom, and techniques of Bohemian folk dances is evident in
many of his compositions, but nowhere more successfully than in his
delightful folk comic opera, <i>The Bartered Bride</i> (<i>Prodan&aacute; neve&#353;ta</i>).
This little opera, first performed in Prague on May 30, 1866, is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
foundation on which Bohemian national music rests securely. It is a
gay, lively picture of life in a small Bohemian village. The principal
action involves the efforts of the village matchmaker to get Marie married
to Wenzel, a dim-witted, stuttering son of the town&rsquo;s wealthy landowner.
But Marie is in love with Hans who, as it turns out, is also the
son of the same landowner, though by a previous marriage. Through
trickery, Hans manages to win Marie, though for a while matters become
complicated when Marie is led to believe that Hans has deserted
her.</p>
<p>In its first version, <i>The Bartered Bride</i> was presented as a play (by
Karel Sabina) with incidental music by Smetana. Realizing that this
work had operatic possibilities, Smetana amplified and revised his score,
and wrote recitatives for the spoken dialogue. In this new extended
form the opera was heard in Vienna in 1892 and was a sensation; from
then on, and to the present time, it has remained one of the most
lovable comic operas ever written.</p>
<p>There are three colorful and dynamic folk dances in this opera which
contribute powerfully to the overall national identity, but whose impact
on audiences is by no means lost when heard apart from the stage
action. &ldquo;The Dance of the Comedians&rdquo; appears in the third act, when
a circus troupe appears in the village square and entertains villagers
with a spirited dance. The &ldquo;Furiant&rdquo;&mdash;a fiery type of Bohemian dance
with marked cross rhythms&mdash;comes in the second act when villagers
enter the local inn and perform a Corybantic dance. The &ldquo;Polka,&rdquo; a
favorite Bohemian dance, comes as an exciting finish to the first act as
local residents give vent to their holiday spirits during a festival in the
village square.</p>
<p>The effervescent overture which precedes the first act is as popular
as the dances. The merry first theme is given by strings and woodwind
in unison against strong chords in brasses and timpani. This subject is
simplified, at times in a fugal style, and is brought to a climax before a
second short subject is stated by the oboe. Still a third charming folk
tune appears, in violins and cellos, before the first main subject is recalled
and developed. The coda, based on this first theme, carries the
overture to a lively conclusion. Gustav Mahler, the eminent music
director of the Vienna Royal Opera which gave this opera its first major
success outside Bohemia, felt this overture was so much in the spirit of
the entire work, and so basic to its overall mood and structure, that he
preferred using it before the second act so that latecomers into the
opera house might not miss it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Smetana&rsquo;s most famous work for orchestra comes from his cycle of
six national tone poems entitled <i>My Country</i> (<i>M&aacute; Vlast</i>), which he
wrote between 1874 and 1879 in a tonal tribute to his native land. Each
of the tone poems is a picture of a different facet of Bohemian life,
geography, and background. The most famous composition of this set
is <i>The Moldau</i> (<i>Vltava</i>), a portrait of the famous Bohemian river. This
is a literal tonal representation of the following descriptive program
interpolated by the composer in his published score:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two springs gush forth in the shade of the Bohemian forest, the
one warm and spouting, the other cold and tranquil. Their waves, gayly
rushing onward over their rocky beds, unite and glisten in the rays of
the morning sun. The forest brook, fast hurrying on, becomes the river
Vltava, which, flowing ever on through Bohemia&rsquo;s valleys, grows to be
a mighty stream; it flows through thick woods in which the joyous noise
of the hunt and the notes of the hunter&rsquo;s horn are heard ever nearer and
nearer; it flows through grass-grown pastures and lowlands where a
wedding feast is celebrated with song and dancing. At night the wood
and water nymphs revel in its shining waves, in which many fortresses
and castles are reflected as witnesses of the past glory of knighthood and
the vanished warlike fame of bygone ages. At St. John Rapids the
stream rushes on, winding in and out through the cataracts, and hews
out a path for itself with its foaming waves through the rocky chasm
into the broad river bed in which it flows on in majestic repose toward
Prague, welcomed by time-honored Vysehrad, whereupon it vanishes in
the far distance from the poet&rsquo;s gaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rippling flow of the river Moldau is portrayed by fast figures in
the strings, the background for a broad and sensual folk song representing
the river itself heard in violins and woodwind. Hunting calls are
sounded by the horns, after which a lusty peasant dance erupts from the
full orchestra. Nymphs and naiads disport to the strains of a brief figure
in the woodwind. A transition by the wind brings back the beautiful
Moldau song. A climax is built up, after which the setting becomes once
again serene. The Moldau continues its serene course towards Prague.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<h2 id="c160"><span class="small">John Philip <b id="g_Sousa">Sousa</b></span></h2>
<p>John Philip Sousa, America&rsquo;s foremost composer of
march music, was born in Washington, D. C., on November 6, 1854.
The son of a trombone player in the United States Marine Band, John
Philip early received music instruction, mainly the violin from John
Esputa. When he was about thirteen, John enlisted in the Marine Corps
where he played in its band for two years. For several years after that
he played the violin in and conducted the orchestras of various theaters;
in the summer of 1877 he played in an orchestra conducted by Jacques
Offenbach at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. Between 1880
and 1892 he was the musical director of the Marine Band. It was during
this period that he wrote his first famous marches. In 1892 he formed a
band of his own with which he toured Europe and America for many
years, and with which he gave more than a thousand concerts. His most
popular marches (together with his best transcriptions for band of
national ballads and patriotic airs) were always the highlights of his
concerts. Besides the marches, Sousa wrote the music for numerous
comic operas, the most famous being <i>El Capitan</i> (1896) and <i>The Bride
Elect</i> (1898). In 1918 Sousa and his band were heard in the Hippodrome
extravaganza, <i>Everything</i>. He published his autobiography,
<i>Marching Along</i>, in 1928, and died in Reading, Pennsylvania, on
March 6, 1932.</p>
<p>In the closing years of the 19th century, and in the first part of the
20th, America was undergoing expansion in many directions: art, science,
literature, commerce, finance, world affairs. Hand in hand with
this development and growth came an aroused patriotism and an expanding
chauvinism. Sousa&rsquo;s marches were the voice of this new and
intense national consciousness.</p>
<p>As Sigmund Spaeth has pointed out, most of Sousa&rsquo;s famous marches
follow a similar pattern, beginning with &ldquo;an arresting introduction,
then using a light, skipping rhythm for his first melody, going from
that into a broader tune,&rdquo; then progressing to the principal march
melody. A massive climax is finally realized with new, vibrant colors
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
being realized in the main march melody through striking new combinations
of instruments.</p>
<p>The following are some of Sousa&rsquo;s most popular marches:</p>
<p><i>El Capitan</i> (1896) was adapted from a choral passage from the comic
opera of the same name. This music was played aboard Admiral
Dewey&rsquo;s flagship, <i>Olympia</i>, when it steamed down Manila Bay for
battle during the Spanish-American War. And it was again heard, this
time performed by Sousa&rsquo;s own band, when Dewey was welcomed as a
conquering hero in New York on September 30, 1900.</p>
<p><i>King Cotton</i> (1895) was written on the occasion of the engagement
of the Sousa Band at the Cotton States Exposition. <i>Semper Fideles</i>
(1888) was Sousa&rsquo;s first famous composition in march tempo, and to this
day it is still one of his best known marches, a perennial favorite with
parades of all kinds. Since Sousa sold this march outright for $35.00 he
never capitalized on its immense popularity.</p>
<p>Sousa&rsquo;s masterpiece&mdash;and probably one of the most famous marches
ever written&mdash;was the <i>Stars and Stripes Forever</i>, completed on April 26,
1897. In 1897 Sousa was a tourist in Italy when he heard the news that
his friend and manager had died in the United States. Sousa decided
to return home. Aboard the <i>Teutonic</i> a march melody kept haunting
him. As soon as he came home he put the melody down on paper, and
it became the principal subject of &ldquo;The Stars and Stripes Forever.&rdquo;
This principal melody achieves an unforgettable climax in the march
when it is proudly thundered by the full orchestra to figurations in the
piccolo.</p>
<p><i>The Thunderer</i> and <i>The Washington Post March</i> were written in
1889. The latter was commissioned by the <i>Washington Post</i> for the ceremonies
attending the presentation of prizes in a student essay contest.</p>
<p>Among Sousa&rsquo;s other marches are <i>The Bride Elect</i> (1897) from the
comic opera of the same name; <i>The Fairest of the Fair</i> (1908); <i>Hands
Across the Sea</i> (1899); <i>Invincible Eagle</i> (1901); and <i>Saber and Spurs</i>
(1915) dedicated to the United States Cavalry.</p>
<p>It was long maintained that Sousa was the composer of the famous
hymn of the Artillery branch of the United States armed services, &ldquo;The
Caisson Song.&rdquo; Sousa played this march in his own brilliant new band
arrangement at a Liberty Loan Drive at the Hippodrome, in New York,
in 1918. For some time thereafter Sousa was credited as being the composer.
But further research revealed the fact that the words and music
had been written in 1908 by Edmund L. Gruber, then a lieutenant with
the 5th Artillery in the Philippines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<h2 id="c161"><span class="small">Oley <b id="g_Speaks">Speaks</b></span></h2>
<p>Oley Speaks was born in Canal Winchester, Ohio, on June
28, 1874. He received his musical training, principally in voice, from
various teachers including Armour Galloway and Emma Thursby. He
then filled the post of baritone soloist at churches in Cleveland, Ohio,
and New York City, including the St. Thomas Church in New York
from 1901 to 1906. He also filled numerous engagements in song recitals
and performances of oratorios. He died in New York City on August 27,
1948.</p>
<p>Speaks was the composer of more than 250 published art songs which
have placed him in a front rank among American song composers.
Three have become outstandingly popular; there is hardly a male
singer anywhere who has not sung such all-time favorites as &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo;
&ldquo;On the Road to Mandalay&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo; each of which is among
the most widely circulated and most frequently heard art songs by an
American. &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; words by Frank L. Stanton, was published in
1910. Where &ldquo;Morning&rdquo; is lyrical, &ldquo;On the Road to Mandalay&rdquo; (published
in 1907) is dramatic, a setting of the famous poem by Rudyard
Kipling. The persistent rhythmic background suggesting drum beats,
and the effective key change from verse to chorus, have an inescapable
effect on listeners. &ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo; poem by Clinton Scollard, published in
1914, is in a sentimental mood, and like &ldquo;Morning&rdquo; reveals the composer&rsquo;s
marked gift for sensitive lyricism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<h2 id="c162"><span class="small">Robert <b id="g_Stolz">Stolz</b></span></h2>
<p>Robert Stolz was born in Graz, Austria, on August 25,
1882. His parents were musical, his father being a successful conductor
and teacher, and his mother a concert pianist. Robert&rsquo;s music study
took place first with his father, then with Robert Fuchs in Vienna and
Humperdinck in Berlin. In 1901 he assumed his first post as conductor,
at an opera house in Brunn. When he was twenty-five he was appointed
conductor of the Theater-an-der-Wien in Vienna where he remained
twelve years, directing most of the masterworks in the field of Austrian
and German operettas. His own career as composer of operettas had begun
in 1903 with <i>Schoen Lorchen</i> produced in Salzburg. Since then
Stolz has written music for about sixty operettas, scores for more than
eighty films, and a thousand songs in all. His music is in the light, graceful,
ebullient style that has characterized Viennese operetta music since
the time of Johann Strauss II. His most famous operettas are: <i>Die lustigen
Weiber von Wien</i> (1909), <i>Die Gluecksmaedel</i> (1910), <i>Die Tanzgraefin</i>
(1921), <i>Peppina</i> (1931), <i>Zwei Herzen in dreiviertel Takt</i> (1933),
<i>Fruehling im Prater</i> (1949) and <i>Karneval in Wien</i> (1950). In 1938 Stolz
came to the United States where for several years he worked in Hollywood.
After the end of World War II he returned to Vienna, remaining
active as a composer not only in that city but also in Berlin and London.</p>
<p>Stolz&rsquo; most famous song is &ldquo;<i>Im Prater bluehn wieder die Baeume</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;In the Prater the Trees Are Again Blooming&rdquo;), a glowing hymn not
only to a district in Vienna famous for its frolic and amusement but
even more so to the city of Vienna itself.</p>
<p>A waltz from his operetta, <i>Two Hearts in Three-Quarter Time</i>
(<i>Zwei Herzen in dreiviertel Takt</i>) is perhaps one of the most celebrated
pieces in three-quarter time written in Vienna since Leh&aacute;r, and it is
loved the world over. This operetta originated in 1931 as a German
motion-picture which won accolades around the world for its charm
and freshness, for which Stolz wrote a score that included his famous
waltz. It was then adapted for the stage by Paul Knepler and J. M. Willeminsky
and introduced in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1933. This delightful
text concerns the trials and tribulations of producing an operetta.
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
That operetta is accepted for production on the condition that a good
waltz melody is written for it, and the composer Toni Hofer gets his
inspiration for that tune from lovely Hedi, the young sister of the librettist.
This waltz, of course, is the title number, which, in its lilt and
buoyancy and Viennese love of life, is in the best tradition of Viennese
popular music.</p>
<h2 id="c163"><span class="small">Oscar <b id="g_Straus">Straus</b></span></h2>
<p>Oscar Straus was no relation to any of the famous Viennese
Strausses; nevertheless in the writing of light, gay music in waltz tempo
and spirited melodies for the operetta stage he was certainly their spiritual
brother. He was born in Vienna on March 6, 1870, and studied
music with private teachers in Vienna and Berlin, including Max
Bruch. In 1901 he settled in Berlin where he became conductor at a
famous cabaret, <i>Ueberbrettl</i>, for whose productions of farces he wrote
a number of scores. Soon after that he turned to writing operettas, becoming
world famous with <i>The Waltz Dream</i> in 1907 and <i>The Chocolate
Soldier</i> in 1908, both introduced in Vienna. He wrote about thirty
operettas after that, many heard with outstanding success in the music
centers of the world. The best of these were <i>Der letzte Walzer</i> (1920),
<i>Die Teresina</i> (1921), <i>Drei Walzer</i> (1935), and <i>Bozena</i> (1952). He was at
his best writing waltz melodies but he was also skilful in interpolating
satirical elements into his musical writing through the exploitation of
ragtime, jazz, and the shimmy. Straus lived in Berlin until 1927, and
for a decade after that he made his home in Vienna and Paris. In 1939
he became a French citizen, and from 1940 to 1948 he lived in the
United States, filling some assignments in Hollywood. He returned to
his native land in 1948, and died at Bad Ischl, Austria, on January 11,
1954.</p>
<p><i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> (<i>Der tapfere Soldat</i>) was the operetta adaptation
of Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s comedy, <i>Arms and the Man</i>, by R. Bernauer and
L. Jacobsen. Its premi&egrave;re took place in Vienna on November 14, 1908,
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
with the first American performance taking place a year later at the
Casino Theater in New York. The setting is Serbia in 1885 where the
hero, Lieutenant Bumerli, gains the nickname of &ldquo;chocolate soldier&rdquo;
because of a sweet tooth. While escaping from the enemy, he finds
refuge in the bedroom of Nadina, daughter of Colonel Popoff. Nadina
becomes the instrument by means of which the lieutenant is now able
to effect his escape, disguised in the coat of Colonel Popolf. But before
the final curtain Bumerli and Nadina also become lovers.</p>
<p>The waltz, &ldquo;My Hero,&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Komm, Komm, Held meiner Traeume</i>&rdquo;)
Nadina&rsquo;s waltz of love to the chocolate soldier, is the most celebrated
excerpt from this operetta. Other familiar pages include the lovely first
act duet of Nadina and Bumerli, &ldquo;Sympathy&rdquo;; the little orchestral
march in the second act, a satirical take off on military pomp and circumstance;
and Nadina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letter Song&rdquo; in the third act.</p>
<p><i>A Waltz Dream</i> (<i>Ein Walzertraum</i>), book by Felix Doermann and
Leopold Jacobsen, was introduced in Vienna on March 2, 1907, and in
New York in April 1908. Lieutenant Niki of the Austrian army is
ordered by the Austrian Emperor to marry Princess Helen, but he falls
in love with Frantzi, a violinist in a girl&rsquo;s orchestra. This love affair becomes
frustrated when Niki must return to Vienna to become Prince
Consort.</p>
<p>The main musical selection from this operetta is the title number, a
waltz which first appears as a duet between Niki and a fellow officer in
the first act, then recurs throughout the operetta, and finally brings it to
a close. Two sprightly march excerpts, from the second and third acts
respectively, and the duet, &ldquo;Piccolo, piccolo, tsin, tsin, tsin&rdquo; are also
popular.</p>
<h2 id="c164"><span class="small"><b id="g_EduardStrauss">Eduard Strauss</b></span></h2>
<p>Eduard Strauss, the younger brother of Johann Strauss II,
was born in Vienna on March 15, 1835. He studied music in Vienna
with G. Preyer following which he made his caf&eacute;-house debut in 1862
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
by conducting his father&rsquo;s orchestra at the Dianasaal. He continued to
lead his father&rsquo;s orchestra at the Volksgarten and Musikverein as well as
at various leading caf&eacute;-houses in Vienna. He also made many tours, including
two of the United States in 1892 and 1901. In 1902 he dissolved
the musical organization which his father had founded three-quarters
of a century earlier and which all that time had dominated the musical
life of Vienna. Besides conducting this orchestra, he also substituted
from time to time for his famous brother, Johann Strauss II, and in
1870 he succeeded him as conductor of the court balls. Eduard Strauss
died in Vienna on December 28, 1916.</p>
<p>Eduard wrote over three hundred popular instrumental compositions
in the style of his celebrated brother but without ever equalling
his remarkable creative freshness and originality. But there is a good
deal of pleasurable listening in Eduard&rsquo;s waltzes and polkas. In the
former category belongs the <i>Doctrinen</i> (<i>Faith</i>) Waltzes, op. 79; in the
latter, the gay <i>Bahn Frei</i> (<i>Fast Track</i>) Polka, op. 45. In collaboration
with his two brothers, Johann and Josef, Eduard wrote the <i>Trifolienwalzer</i>
and the <i>Schuetzenquadrille</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c165"><span class="small"><b id="g_JohannStraussI">Johann Strauss I</b></span></h2>
<p>Johann Strauss I was one of the two waltz kings of
Vienna bearing that name. The more famous one, the composer of
&ldquo;The Blue Danube&rdquo; was the son. But the father was also one of
Vienna&rsquo;s most popular composers and caf&eacute;-house conductors. He was
born in Vienna on March 14, 1804, and as a boy he studied both the
violin and harmony. His love for music, combined with the decision of
his parents to make him a bookbinder, led him to run away from home.
When he was fifteen he joined Michael Pamer&rsquo;s orchestra which played
at the Sperl caf&eacute;; another of its members was Josef Lanner, soon also
to become a major figure in Vienna&rsquo;s musical life. As Lanner&rsquo;s star rose,
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
so did Johann Strauss&rsquo;. First Strauss played in the Lanner Quartet at the
<i>Goldenen Rebbuhn</i> and other caf&eacute;s; after that he was a member of the
Lanner Orchestra which appeared in Vienna&rsquo;s leading caf&eacute;s. When
Lanner&rsquo;s mounting success made it necessary for him to create two
orchestras, he selected Johann Strauss to conduct one of them. Then, in
1826, Johann Strauss formed an orchestra of his own which made its
debut at the Bock Caf&eacute;. For the next two decades he was the idol of
Vienna, Lanner&rsquo;s only rival. By 1830 he had two hundred musicians
under him. His major successes as a caf&eacute;-house conductor came at the
Sperl and the Redoutensaal. But his fame spread far beyond Vienna. In
1833 he toured all Austria, and in 1834 he appeared in Berlin. After
that he performed in all the major European capitals, achieving formidable
successes in London and Paris. Meanwhile, in 1833, he had become
bandmaster of the first Vienna militia regiment, one of the highest
honors a performer of light music could achieve in Austria. In
1845 he was appointed conductor of the Viennese court balls. He died
in Vienna on September 25, 1849.</p>
<p>Like Lanner, Strauss wrote a considerable amount of dance and caf&eacute;-house
music, over 250 compositions. His first composition was the
<i>Taeuberlwalzer</i>, named after the caf&eacute; <i>Zwei Tauben</i> where he was then
appearing. After that he wrote waltzes, galops, polkas, quadrilles, cotillons,
contredanses, and marches&mdash;which Vienna came to love for their
rhythmic vitality and appealing lyricism. People in Vienna used to say
that the waltzes of the first Johann Strauss were <i>made</i> for dancing because
their rhythmic pulse excited the heart and made feet restless.</p>
<p>Not much of the father Strauss&rsquo; library of music has survived. The
exceptions are the following waltzes: <i>Caecilien</i>, <i>Donaulieder</i>, the <i>Kettenbruecken</i>,
and the <i>Lorelei Rheinsklaenge</i>. To the waltz, the older
Johann Strauss brought a symphonic dimension it had heretofore not
known, particularly in his spacious introductions of which the thirty-bar
prelude of the <i>Lorelei Rheinsklaenge</i> is an outstanding example.
He also carried over to the waltz a variety of mood and feeling and a
lightness of touch new for this peasant dance. &ldquo;This demon of the
ancient Viennese folk spirit,&rdquo; wrote Richard Wagner after hearing
Strauss perform one of his own waltzes in Vienna, &ldquo;trembled at the beginning
of a new waltz like a python preparing to spring, and it was
more the ecstasy produced by the music than the drinks among the enchanted
audience that stimulated that magical first violin to almost
dangerous flights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his other music the most famous is the <i>Radetzky March</i>. Count
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
Radetzky was an Austrian military hero, victor over the Italians in
1848-1849. In honor of his Italian triumphs and suppression of the
Italian nationalist movement, Strauss wrote the spirited, sharply accented
march in 1848 which almost at once became the musical symbol
of Hapsburg Vienna and Austrian military power. The following programmatic
interpretation of this music by H. E. Jacob is of interest:
&ldquo;Drunk with triumph, the Generalissimo&rsquo;s battalions hurl themselves
down into Lombardy. They are close on the heels of the fleeing troops
of King Albert, the King of Sardinia. And then comes a new phase of
the march to accompany the victorious troops. A different sun shines
down on this, a memory of Vienna, a lingering trace of the feel of girls&rsquo;
arms; scraps of a dance song with a backward glance at three-quarter
time. But on they go, still forward. There are no more shots, there is
laughter. The trio follows. The ... superdominant ... hoisted as
if it were a flag.... Finally comes the return of the principal theme
with the laurels and gaiety of victory.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c166"><span class="small"><b id="g_JohannStraussIi">Johann Strauss II</b></span></h2>
<p>Johann Strauss II, son of the first Johann Strauss, was
born in Vienna on October 25, 1825. Though he showed an unmistakable
bent for music from his childhood on, he was forbidden by his
father to study music or to indulge in any musical activity whatsoever.
The young Johann Strauss, encouraged by his mother, was forced to
study the violin surreptitiously with a member of his father&rsquo;s orchestra.
Only after the father had deserted his family, to set up another home
with his mistress, did young Johann begin to devote himself completely
and openly to music. After studying the violin with Kohlmann and
counterpoint with Joseph Drechsler, he made his debut as a caf&eacute;-house
conductor and composer at Dommayer&rsquo;s Casino in Hietzing, near
Vienna, on October 15, 1844. The event was widely publicized and
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
dramatized in Vienna, since the son was appearing as a rival to his
father. For this momentous debut, the son wrote the first of his waltzes&mdash;the
<i>Gunstwerber</i> and the <i>Sinngedichte</i>&mdash;which aroused immense enthusiasm.
He had to repeat the last-named waltz so many times that the
people in the caf&eacute; lost count. &ldquo;Ah, these Viennese,&rdquo; reported the editor
of <i>The Wanderer</i>. &ldquo;A new waltz player, a piece of world history. Good
night, Lanner. Good evening, Father Strauss. Good morning, Son
Strauss.&rdquo; The father had not attended this performance, but learned of
his son&rsquo;s triumph from one of his cronies.</p>
<p>Thus a new waltz king had arisen in Vienna. His reign continued
until the end of the century. For fifty years Johann Strauss II stood
alone and unequalled as the musical idol of Vienna. His performances
were the talk of the town. His own music was on everyone&rsquo;s lips. After
the death of father Strauss in 1849, he combined members of the older
man&rsquo;s orchestra with his own, and toured all of Europe with the augmented
ensemble. From 1863 to 1870 he was conductor of the Viennese
balls, a post once held by his father. In 1872 he made sensational appearances
in Boston and New York. All the while he was writing some of
the most famous waltzes ever written, as well as quadrilles and polkas
and other dance pieces. And in 1871, with the premi&egrave;re in Vienna of
<i>Indigo</i> he entered upon a new field, that of the operetta, in which once
again he was to become a dominating figure. He was admired not
merely by the masses but also by some of the greatest musicians of his
generation&mdash;Brahms, Wagner, Verdi, Hans von Buelow, Offenbach,
Goldmark, Gounod, all of whom expressed their admiration for his
music in no uncertain terms. In 1894, Vienna celebrated the 50th anniversary
of his debut with a week of festive performances; congratulations
poured into Vienna from all parts of the civilized world. He died
five years after that&mdash;in Vienna on June 3, 1899&mdash;and was buried near
Schubert, Beethoven, and Brahms.</p>
<p>It is perhaps singularly fitting that Johann Strauss should have died
in 1899. A century was coming to an end, and with it an entire epoch.
This is what one court official meant when he said that &ldquo;Emperor Francis
Joseph reigned until the death of Johann Strauss.&rdquo; History, with its
cold precision, may accurately record that the reign of Francis Joseph
actually terminated in 1916. But its heyday had passed with the 19th
century. The spirit of old Vienna, imperial Vienna of the Hapsburgs,
the Vienna that had been inspiration for song and story, died with
Johann Strauss. After 1900, Vienna was only a shadow of its former
self, and was made prostrate by World War I.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>If the epoch of &ldquo;old Vienna&rdquo; died with Johann Strauss, it was also
born with him. After 1825, the social and intellectual climate in the
imperial city changed perceptibly. The people, always gay, now gave
themselves up to frivolity. For this, political conditions had been responsible.
The autocratic rule of Francis I brought on tyranny, repression,
and an army of spies and informers. As a result, the Viennese went
in for diversions that were safe from a political point of view: flirtation,
gossip, dancing. They were partial to light musical plays and novels.
Thus, an attitude born out of expediency, became, with the passing of
time, an inextricable part of everyday life in Vienna.</p>
<p>Of the many light-hearted pleasures in which the Viennese indulged
none was dearer to them than dancing. It has been recorded that one
out of every four in Vienna danced regularly. They danced the polka,
and the quadrille; but most of all they danced the waltz.</p>
<p>Johann Strauss II was the genius of the Viennese waltz. More than
anybody before him or since he lifted the popular dance to such artistic
importance that his greatest waltzes are often performed at symphony
concerts by the world&rsquo;s greatest orchestras under the foremost conductors.
Inexhaustible was his invention; richly inventive, his harmonic
writing; subtle and varied his gift at orchestration; fresh and personal
his lyricism; aristocratic his structure. To the noted 20th century German
critic, Paul Bekker, the Strauss waltz contained &ldquo;more melodies
than a symphony of Beethoven, and the aggregate of Straussian melodies
is surely greater than the aggregate of Beethoven&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually the waltz form used by Strauss is basically that of Lanner
and of Strauss&rsquo; own father. A slow symphonic introduction opens the
waltz. This is followed by a series of waltz melodies (usually five in
number). A symphonic coda serves both as a kind of summation and as
a conclusion. But here the similarity with the past ends. This form
received from the younger Strauss new dimension, new amplification.
His introductions are sometimes like tone poems. The waltz melodies
are incomparably rich in thought and feeling, varied in mood and style.
A new concept of thematic developments enters waltz writing with
Strauss. And his codas, as his introductions, are symphonic creations
built with consummate skill from previously stated ideas, or fragments
of these ideas. No wonder, then, that the waltzes of Johann Strauss have
been described as &ldquo;symphonies for dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following are the most popular of the Johann Strauss waltzes:</p>
<p><i>Acceleration</i> (<i>Accelerationen</i>), op. 234, as the title indicates, derives
its effect from the gradual acceleration in tempo in the main waltz
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
melody. Strauss had promised to write a waltz for a ball at the Sofiensaal
but failed to deliver his manuscript even at the zero hour. Reminded
of his promise, he sat down at a restaurant table on the night of the ball
and hurriedly wrote off the complete <i>Acceleration Waltz</i> on the back
of a menu card, and soon thereafter conducted the premi&egrave;re performance.</p>
<p><i>Artist&rsquo;s Life</i> (<i>Kuenstlerleben</i>), op. 316, opens in a tender mood. A
transition is provided by an alternation of soft and loud passages, after
which the first waltz melody erupts zestfully as a tonal expression of the
lighthearted gaiety of an artist&rsquo;s life. A similar mood is projected by
the other waltz melodies.</p>
<p><i>The Blue Danube</i> (<i>An der schoenen blauen Donau</i>), op. 314, is perhaps
the most famous waltz ever written, and one of the greatest. It is
now a familiar tale how Brahms, while autographing a fan of Strauss&rsquo;
wife, scribbled a few bars of this waltz and wrote underneath, &ldquo;alas, not
by Brahms.&rdquo; Strauss wrote <i>The Blue Danube</i> at the request of John
Herbeck, conductor of the Vienna Men&rsquo;s Singing Society; thus the
original version of the waltz is for chorus and orchestra, the text being
a poem by Karl Beck in praise of Vienna and the Danube. Strauss wrote
this waltz in 1867, and it was introduced on February 15 of the same
year at the Dianasaal by Strauss&rsquo; orchestra, supplemented by Herbeck&rsquo;s
singing society. The audience was so enthusiastic that it stood on the
seats and thundered for numerous repetitions. In the Spring of 1867,
Strauss introduced his waltz to Paris at the International Exposition
where it was a sensation. A tremendous ovation also greeted it when
Strauss performed it for the first time in London, at Covent Garden in
1869. When Johann Strauss made his American debut, in Boston in
1872, he conducted <i>The Blue Danube</i> with an orchestra numbering a
thousand instruments and a chorus of a thousand voices! Copies of the
music were soon in demand in far-off cities of Asia and Australia. The
publisher, Spina, was so deluged by orders he had to have a hundred
new copper plates made from which to print over a million copies.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see why this waltz is so popular. It is an eloquent
voice of the &ldquo;charm, elegance, vivacity, and sophistication&rdquo; of 19th century
Vienna&mdash;so much so that it is second only to Haydn&rsquo;s Austrian
National Anthem as the musical symbol of Austria.</p>
<p><i>Emperor Waltz</i> (<i>Kaiserwalz</i>), op. 437, was written in 1888 to celebrate
the 40th anniversary of the reign of Franz Joseph I. This is one
of Strauss&rsquo; most beautiful waltzes. A slow introduction spanning seventy-four
bars that has delicacy and grace, and is of a stately march-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
character, is Viennese to its very marrow. A suggestion of the main waltz
tune then appears quickly but is just as quickly dismissed by a loud return
of the main introductory subject. Trombones lead to a brief
silence. After some preparation, a waltz melody of rare majesty finally
unfolds in the strings. If this wonderful waltz melody can be said to
represent the Emperor himself then the delightful waltz tunes that follow&mdash;some
of almost peasant character&mdash;can be said to speak for the joy
of the Austrian people in honoring their beloved monarch. An elaborate
coda then comes as the crown to the whole composition.</p>
<p><i>Morning Journals</i> (<i>Morgenblaetter</i>), op. 279, was written for a Viennese
press club, the Concordia. Offenbach had previously written for
that club a set of waltzes entitled &ldquo;<i>Evening Journals</i>.&rdquo; Strauss decided
to name his music <i>Morning Journals</i>. The Offenbach composition is today
remembered only because it provided the stimulus for Strauss&rsquo; title.
But Strauss&rsquo; music remains&mdash;the four waltzes in his freshest and most
infectious lyric vein, and its introduction highlighted by a melody of
folk song simplicity.</p>
<p><i>Roses from the South</i> (<i>Rosen aus dem Sueden</i>), op. 388, is a potpourri
of the best waltz tunes (each a delight) from one of the composer&rsquo;s
lesser operettas, <i>Spitzentuch der Koenigen</i> (<i>The Queen&rsquo;s Lace Handkerchief</i>).
The &ldquo;south&rdquo; in the title refers to Spain, the background of
the operetta, but there is nothing Spanish to this unmistakably Viennese
music.</p>
<p><i>Tales from the Vienna Woods</i> (<i>G&rsquo;schichten aus dem Wiener Wald</i>),
op. 325&mdash;performed for the first time by the Strauss orchestra at the
<i>Neue Welt</i> caf&eacute; in 1868&mdash;is a bucolic picture of Nature&rsquo;s beauty in the
forests skirting Vienna. The beauty of Nature is suggested in the stately
introduction with its open fifths and its serene melody for cello followed
by a flute cadenza. All the loveliness of the Vienna woods is then
represented by a waltz melody (originally scored for zither, but now
most often presented by strings), a loveliness that is carried on with
incomparable grace and charm by the ensuing waltz tunes.</p>
<p><i>Vienna Blood</i> (<i>Wiener Blut</i>), op. 354, like so many other Strauss
waltzes, is a hymn of praise to Strauss&rsquo; native cities; but where other
waltzes are light and carefree, this one is more often moody, dreamy,
and at times sensual. After the introduction come four waltz melodies,
the first full of fire and the last one touched with sentimentality. The
second and third waltz tunes are interesting for their rhythmic vitality
and marked syncopations.</p>
<p><i>Voices of Spring</i> (<i>Fruehlingstimmen</i>), op. 410&mdash;dedicated to the renowned
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
Viennese pianist, Albert Gruenfeld&mdash;is (like the <i>Tales from
the Vienna Woods</i>) an exuberant picture of the vernal season, the joy
and thrill that the rebirth of Nature always provides to the Viennese.</p>
<p><i>Wine, Woman and Song</i> (<i>Wein, Weib und Gesang</i>), op. 333, opens
with an eloquent mood picture that is virtually an independent composition,
even though it offers suggestions of later melodies. This is a
spacious ninety-one bar introduction that serves as an eloquent peroration
to the four waltz melodies that follow&mdash;each graceful, vivacious,
and at times tender and contemplative. Richard Wagner, upon hearing
Anton Seidl conduct this music, was so moved by it that at one point
he seized the baton from Seidl&rsquo;s hand and conducted the rest of the
piece himself.</p>
<p>Strauss wrote other dance music besides waltzes. He was equally successful
in bringing his wonderful melodic invention, fine rhythmic
sense, and beautiful instrumentation to the Polka, the native Bohemian
dance in duple quick time and in a lively mood. The best of the Strauss
polkas are: <i>Annen-Polka</i>, op. 117; <i>Electrophor Polka</i>, op. 297 dedicated
to the students of a Vienna technical school, its effect derived from its
breathless tempo and forceful dynamics; <i>Explosions Polka</i>, op. 43, written
when Strauss was only twenty-two and characterized by sudden brief
crescendos; <i>Pizzicato Polka</i>, written in collaboration with the composer&rsquo;s
brother Josef, and, as the name indicates, an exercise in plucked
strings; and the capricious <i>Tritsch-Tratsch</i> (or <i>Chit-Chat</i>) <i>Polka</i>, op.
214.</p>
<p>Of Strauss&rsquo; other instrumental compositions, the best known is a
lively excursion in velocity called <i>Perpetual Motion</i>, op. 257, which the
composer himself described as a &ldquo;musical jest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond being Vienna&rsquo;s waltz king, Johann Strauss II was also one of
its greatest composers of operettas. Indeed, if a vote were to be cast for
the greatest favorite among all Vienna operettas the chances are the
choice would fall on Strauss&rsquo; <i>Die Fledermaus</i> (<i>The Bat</i>), first produced
in Vienna on April 5, 1874, book by Carl Haffner and Richard Gen&eacute;e
based on a French play by Meilhac and Hal&eacute;vy. This work is not
only a classic of the light theater, but even a staple in the repertory
of the world&rsquo;s major opera houses. It is a piece of dramatic intrigue
filled with clever, bright and at times risqu&eacute; humor, as well as irony and
gaiety. The plot, in line with operetta tradition, involves a love intrigue:
between Rosalinda, wife of Baron von Eisenstein, and Alfred.
The Baron is sought by the police for some slight indiscretion, and
when they come to the Baron&rsquo;s home and find Alfred there, they mistake
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
him for the Baron and arrest him. Upon discovering he is supposed
to be in jail, the Baron decides to take full advantage of his liberty by
attending a masked ball at Prince Orlovsky&rsquo;s palace and making advances
there to the lovely women. But one of the masked women with
whom he flirts is his own wife. Eventually, the identity of both is uncovered,
to the embarrassment of the Baron, and this merry escapade
ends when the Baron is compelled to spend his time in jail.</p>
<p>The overture is a classic, recreating the effervescent mood that prevails
throughout the operetta. It is made up of some of the principal
melodies of the opera: Rosalinda&rsquo;s lament, &ldquo;<i>So muss allein ich bleiben</i>&rdquo;
first heard in the woodwind; the chorus, &ldquo;<i>O je, o je, wie ruhrt mich
dies</i>&rdquo; in the strings; and most important of all, the main waltz of the
operetta and the climax of the second act, also in the strings.</p>
<p>Other delightful episodes frequently presented in instrumental versions
include the lovely drinking song, &ldquo;<i>Trinke, Liebchen, trinke
schnell</i>&rdquo;; the laughing song of the maid, Adele, &ldquo;<i>Mein Herr Marquis</i>&rdquo;;
the blood-warming czardas of the &ldquo;Hungarian countess&rdquo; who is actually
Rosalinda in disguise, &ldquo;<i>Klaenge der Heimat</i>&rdquo;; the stirring hymn to
champagne, &ldquo;<i>Die Majistaet wird anerkannt</i>&rdquo;; and the buoyant waltz,
&ldquo;<i>Du und du</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Gypsy Baron</i> (<i>Die Ziguenerbaron</i>) is almost as popular as <i>Die
Fledermaus</i>. This is an operetta with libretto by Ignaz Schnitzer, introduced
in Vienna on October 24, 1885. Sand&oacute;r Barinkay returns to his
ancestral home after having left it as a child. He finds it swarming with
gypsies who have made it their home, and he falls in love with one of
them, Saffi.</p>
<p>The overture is made up of material from the concerted finales, beginning
with the entrance of the gypsies in the first finale; continuing
with Saffi&rsquo;s celebrated gypsy air, &ldquo;<i>So elend und treu</i>&rdquo;; and culminating
with the celebrated waltz music of the second act, the <i>Schatz</i>, or <i>Treasure</i>,
waltzes.</p>
<p>Other familiar excerpts include Sand&oacute;r&rsquo;s exuberant aria with chorus
from the first act &ldquo;<i>Ja, das alles auf Ehr</i>,&rdquo; probably the most celebrated
vocal excerpt from the entire operetta; and the <i>Entry March</i> (<i>Einzugmarsch</i>)
from the third act&mdash;for chorus and orchestra in the operetta,
but often given by salon ensembles in an orchestral version.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<h2 id="c167"><span class="small"><b id="g_JosefStrauss">Josef Strauss</b></span></h2>
<p>Josef Strauss, like Eduard, is a younger brother of Johann
Strauss II, and son of Johann Strauss I. He was born in Vienna on
August 22, 1827. He was an extremely talented young man not only in
music but even as architect and inventor. Of more serious and sober
disposition than either of his two brothers, he long regarded caf&eacute;-house
music condescendingly, his musical preference being for the classics.
His famous brother, Johann Strauss II, needing someone to help him
direct his orchestra, finally prevailed on Josef to turn to caf&eacute;-house
music. Josef made his debut as caf&eacute;-house conductor and composer
simultaneously on July 23, 1853, his first waltz being <i>Die Ersten</i>. After
that he often substituted for brother Johann in directing the latter&rsquo;s
orchestra in Vienna and on extended tours of Europe and Russia. Josef
died in Vienna on July 21, 1870.</p>
<p>Josef Strauss wrote almost three hundred dance compositions.
Though certainly less inspired than his brother, Johann, he was also far
more important than Eduard. Josef&rsquo;s best waltzes have much of the
lyrical invention, and the harmonic and instrumental invention of
those by Johann Strauss II. Perhaps his greatest waltz is the <i>Dorfschwalben
aus Oesterreich</i> (<i>Swallows from Austria</i>), op. 164, a nature portrait
often interrupted by the chirping of birds. Here Josef&rsquo;s outpouring of
the most sensitive lyricism and delicate moods is hardly less wondrous
than that of Johann Strauss II. H. E. Jacob went so far as to say that
&ldquo;since Schubert&rsquo;s death there has been no such melody. It is in the realm
of the Impromptus and Moments Musicaux. It breathes the sweet blue
from which the swallows come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another Josef Strauss classic in three-quarter time is <i>Sphaerenklaenge</i>
(<i>Music of the Spheres</i>), op. 285, equally remarkable for its spontaneous
flow of unforgettable waltz tunes. Among Strauss&rsquo; other delightful
waltzes are the <i>Aquarellen</i>, op. 258; <i>Delirien</i>, op. 212; <i>Dynamiden</i>, op.
173; <i>Marienklaenge</i>, op. 214. A theme from <i>Dynamiden</i> waltzes was
used by Richard Strauss in his famous opera <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i>.</p>
<p>In collaboration with his brother, Johann, Josef wrote the famous
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
<i>Pizzicato Polka</i> and several other pieces including the <i>Monstrequadrille</i>
and <i>Vaterlandischer March</i>. With Johann and Eduard he wrote the
<i>Schuetzenquadrille</i> and the <i>Trifolienwalzer</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c168"><span class="small">Sir Arthur <b id="g_Sullivan">Sullivan</b></span></h2>
<p>Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan&mdash;musical half
of the comic-opera team of Gilbert and Sullivan&mdash;was born in London,
England, on May 13, 1842. The son of a bandmaster, Sullivan was appointed
to the Chapel Royal School in 1854. One year after that his first
published composition appeared, an anthem. In 1856 he was the first
recipient of the recently instituted Mendelssohn Award which entitled
him to attend the Royal Academy of Music where he studied under
Sterndale Bennett and Goss. From 1858 to 1861 he attended the Leipzig
Conservatory. After returning to London in 1862, he achieved recognition
as a serious composer with several ambitious compositions including
the <i>Irish Symphony</i>, a cello concerto, a cantata, and an oratorio.
Meanwhile, in 1866, he had become professor of composition at the
Royal Academy, and in 1867 he completed his first score in a light style,
the comic opera <i>Cox and Box</i>, libretto by F. C. Burnand, which enjoyed
a successful engagement in London.</p>
<p>In 1871, a singer introduced Sullivan to W. S. Gilbert, a one-time
attorney who had attracted some interest in London as the writer of
burlesques. An enterprising impresario, John Hollingshead of the
Gaiety Theater, then was responsible for getting Gilbert and Sullivan
to work on their first operetta. This was <i>Thespis</i>, produced in London
in 1871, and a failure. It was several years before librettist and composer
worked together again. When they did it was for a new impresario,
Richard D&rsquo;Oyly Carte, for whom they wrote a one-act comic opera,
<i>Trial by Jury</i>, a curtain raiser to a French operetta which Carte was producing
in London on March 25, 1875. <i>Trial by Jury</i>&mdash;a stinging satire
on court trials revolving around a breach of promise suit&mdash;inaugurates
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
the epoch of Gilbert and Sullivan. D&rsquo;Oyly Carte now commissioned
Gilbert and Sullivan to create a new full length comic opera for a company
he had recently formed. The new light opera company made a
successful bow with <i>The Sorcerer</i>, on November 17, 1877. <i>Pinafore</i>, a
year later on May 25, 1878, made Gilbert and Sullivan a vogue and a
passion both in London and in New York. In 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan
came to the United States where on December 31 they introduced a new
comic opera, <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, that took the country by storm.
Upon returning to London, Gilbert and Sullivan opened a new theater
built for them by D&rsquo;Oyly Carte&mdash;the Savoy&mdash;with <i>Patience</i>, a tumultuous
success on April 25, 1881. After that came <i>Iolanthe</i> (1882), <i>Princess
Ida</i> (1884), <i>The Mikado</i> (1885), the <i>Yeomen of the Guard</i> (1888)
and <i>The Gondoliers</i> (1889).</p>
<p>Gilbert and Sullivan came to the parting of the ways in 1890, the
final rift precipitated by a silly argument over the cost of a carpet for
the Savoy Theater. But the differences between them had long been
deep rooted. An attempt to revive the partnership was made in 1893
with <i>Utopia Limited</i>, and again with <i>The Grand Duke</i> in 1896. Both
comic operas were failures.</p>
<p>After 1893, Sullivan wrote a grand opera, <i>Ivanhoe</i>, and several
operetta scores to librettists other than Sullivan. None of these were
successful. During the last years of his life he suffered from deterioration
of his health, and was almost always in acute pain. He died in London
on November 22, 1900. Gilbert died eleven years after that.</p>
<p>Of Sullivan&rsquo;s other achievements in the field of music mention must
be made of his importance as a conductor of the concerts of the London
Philharmonic from 1885 to 1887, and of the Leeds Festival from 1880
to 1898. Between 1876 and 1881 he was principal of, and professor of
composition at, the National Training School for Music. In recognition
of his high estate in English music, he was the recipient of many honors.
In 1878 he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and in 1883 he
was knighted by Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>It is irony fitting for a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera that the
music on which Sullivan lavished his most fastidious attention and of
which he was most proud has been completely forgotten (except for
one or two minor exceptions). But the music upon which he looked
with such condescension and self apology is that which has made him
an immortal&mdash;in the theater if not in the concert world. For where Sullivan
was heavy-handed, pretentious, and often stilted in his oratorios,
serious operas, and orchestral compositions, he was consistently vital,
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
fresh, personal, and vivacious in his lighter music. In setting Gilbert&rsquo;s
lyrics to music, Sullivan was always capable of finding the musical <i>mot
juste</i> to catch every nuance of Gilbert&rsquo;s wit and satire. So neatly, even
inevitably, does the music fit the words that it is often difficult to think
of one without the other. Like Gilbert, Sullivan was a master of parody
and satire; he liked particularly to mock at the pretensions of grand
opera, oratorio, and the sentimental ballad, pretensions of which he
himself was a victim when he endeavored to work in those fields. Like
Gilbert, he had a pen that raced with lightning velocity in the writing
of patter music to patter verses. Sullivan, moreover, had a reservoir of
melodies seemingly inexhaustible&mdash;gay tunes, mocking tunes, and tunes
filled with telling sentiment&mdash;and he was able to adapt the fullest resources
of his remarkable gift at harmony, rhythm and orchestration to
the manifold demands of the stage. He was no man&rsquo;s imitator. Without
having recourse to experimentation or unorthodox styles and techniques,
his style and manners were so uniquely his that, as T. F. Dunhill
has said, &ldquo;his art is always recognizable.... The Sullivan touch is
unmistakable and can be felt instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the universality of the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, Isaac
Goldberg wrote: &ldquo;They [Gilbert and Sullivan] were not the rebels of
an era, yet as surely they were not the apologists. Their light laughter
carried a pleasant danger of its own that, without being the laughter of
a Figaro, helped before the advent of a Shaw to keep the atmosphere
clear. Transition figures they were, in an age of transition, caught between
the personal independence of the artist and the social imperatives
of their station. They did not cross over into the new day, though
they served as a footbridge for others. Darwin gave them ... only a
song for <i>Princess Ida</i>, their melodious answer to the revolt of woman
against a perfumed slavery; Swinburne and Wilde ... characters for
<i>Patience</i>. They chided personal foibles, and only indirectly social
abuses. They were, after all, moralists not sociologists. It was in their
natures; it was of their position. Yet something vital in them lives beyond
their time. From their era of caste, of smug rectitude, of sanctimoniousness,
they still speak to an age that knows neither corset nor
petticoat, that votes with its women, and finds Freud insufficiently
aphrodisiac. Perhaps it is because they chide individuals and not institutions
that their work, so admirably held in solution by Sullivan&rsquo;s
music, has lived through the most critical epoch in modern history since
the French Revolution. For, underneath the cataclysmic changes of history
remain the foibles that make us the fit laughter of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>Overtures to and potpourris from the principal Gilbert and Sullivan
comic operas are integral to the repertory of salon and pop orchestras
everywhere. In all cases, the overture is made up of the opera&rsquo;s main
melodies, and in most cases these overtures were written by others.</p>
<p><i>The Gondoliers</i> was the last of the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas
to survive in the permanent repertory. It was produced on December 7,
1889. After the operatic pretension of the <i>Yeomen of the Guard</i> which
had preceded it, <i>The Gondoliers</i> represented a welcome return by the
authors to the world of paradox, absurdity, and confusion. It has aptly
been described as a &ldquo;farce of errors.&rdquo; The setting is Venice in the middle
of the 18th century. The Duke and Duchess of Plaza-Toro come to
Venice accompanied by their daughter, Casilda, and a drummer boy,
Luiz, who loves her. In her childhood, Casilda had married the infant
heir to the throne of Barataria. This heir had then been stolen and entrusted
to the care of a gondolier who raised him as one of his two sons.
In time the gondolier himself has forgotten which of his two boys is of
royal blood. To complicate matters even further, the two gondolier
boys, Marco and Giuseppe, are married. Thus it seems impossible to
solve the problem as to who really is the heir to Barataria&rsquo;s throne and
by the same token Gasilda&rsquo;s husband. But when this problem is finally
unscrambled it turns out that the heir is neither Marco nor Giuseppe,
but none other than Luiz.</p>
<p>The following are the principal selections from <i>The Gondoliers</i>:
Antonio&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;For the Merriest Fellows Are We&rdquo;; the duet of Marco
and Giuseppe, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Called Gondolieri&rdquo;; the autobiographical chant
of the Duke of Plaza-Toro, &ldquo;The Duke of Plaza-Toro&rdquo;; the duet of
Casilda and Luiz, &ldquo;There Was a Time&rdquo;; the song of the Grand Inquisitor,
&ldquo;I Stole the Prince&rdquo;; Tessa&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;When a Merry Maiden Marries&rdquo;;
the duet of Marco and Giuseppe, &ldquo;For Everyone Who Feels Inclined&rdquo;;
Giuseppe&rsquo;s patter song, &ldquo;Rising Early in the Morning&rdquo;;
Marco&rsquo;s serenade, &ldquo;Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes&rdquo;; and the song of
the Duchess, &ldquo;On the Day that I was Wedded.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Iolanthe</i>, introduced on November 25, 1882, carried Gilbert&rsquo;s love
of paradox, confusion and absurdity into the fairy kingdom. To Isaac
Goldberg, this comic opera, both as words and as music is &ldquo;a peer among
its kind. It is surprisingly complete. It is, indeed, of Gilbert and of Sullivan,
all compact. The Gilbertian conflict between reality and fantasy
is mirrored in details great and small&mdash;in scene, costume, in line, in gesture....
It would be difficult to find among the remaining thirteen
comic operas one that reveals the collaborators playing so neatly into
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
each other&rsquo;s hands&mdash;responding so closely to the conscious and unconscious
demands of the reciprocal personality.&rdquo; The heroine, Iolanthe,
is a fairy who has married a mortal and thus has been banished to the
bottom of a stream by the Queen of her kingdom. But the Queen
eventually forgives Iolanthe. Upon returning to her fairy kingdom,
Iolanthe discovers she is the mother of a son, Strephon, who is half fairy
and half mortal; and Strephon is in love with the mortal, Phyllis, who,
in turn, is being pursued not only by her guardian, the Lord Chancellor,
but even by the entire House of Peers. When Phyllis finds Strephon
with Iolanthe she suspects him of infidelity, since she has no idea that
Iolanthe is Strephon&rsquo;s mother. Immediately she begins to bestow her
kindly glances upon two members of the House of Peers. Summoned for
help, Iolanthe reveals that Strephon is, indeed, her son, and that his
father is none other than the Lord Chancellor. By this time the other
fairies of the kingdom have succumbed to the charms and appeal of the
Peers. Iolanthe is saved from a second punishment when the Lord
Chancellor helps change fairy law to read that any fairy <i>not</i> marrying a
mortal is subject to death.</p>
<p>Leading numbers from <i>Iolanthe</i> include the following: the opening
chorus of the fairies, &ldquo;Tripping Hither, Tripping Thither&rdquo;; Strephon&rsquo;s
song, &ldquo;Good Morrow, good Mother&rdquo;; the love duet of Phyllis and
Strephon, &ldquo;Thou the Tree and I the Flower&rdquo;; Entrance, chorus, and
march of the Peers, &ldquo;Loudly Let the Trumpet Bray&rdquo; followed immediately
by the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s monologue, &ldquo;The Law is the True
Embodiment&rdquo;; the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s personal credo, &ldquo;When I Went
to the Bar&rdquo;; the song of Willis, the sentry, &ldquo;When All Night Long a
Chap Remains&rdquo;; Lord Mount Arrat&rsquo;s chauvinistic hymn, &ldquo;When Britain
Really Ruled the Waves&rdquo;; the Fairy Queen&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Oh, Foolish
Fay&rdquo;; the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s patter song about a nightmare, &ldquo;When
You&rsquo;re Lying Awake&rdquo;; the trio of the Lord Chancellor, Mount Ararat
and Tolloler, &ldquo;If You Go In&rdquo;; Strephon&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Fold Your Flapping
Wings&rdquo;; and the finale, &ldquo;Soon as We May.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Mikado</i> was a sensation when first performed in London on
March 14, 1885; and with many it is still the favorite of all Gilbert and
Sullivan comic operas. By 1900, it had received over one thousand performances
in London and five thousand in the United States. Since
then these figures have multiplied. It has been adapted for motion pictures,
and in New York it has been given in two different jazz versions
(<i>The Hot Mikado</i> and <i>Swing Mikado</i>). In 1960 it was presented over
television with Groucho Marx as the Lord High Executioner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>In its own day much of its appeal was due to its exotic setting of
Japan and strange Japanese characters. Such a novelty for the English
stage was the strong spice that endowed the play with much of its succulent
flavor. Gilbert&rsquo;s inspiration had been a miniature Japanese village
set up in the Knightsbridge section of London which aroused and
stimulated the interest of the English people in all things Japanese. Gilbert
was one of those who became fascinated by this Oriental exhibit,
and his fascination led him to conceive a comic opera with a Japanese
background.</p>
<p>But while the Japanese are certainly no longer curiosities in the theater&mdash;have,
indeed, become a vogue on Broadway since the end of World
War II&mdash;<i>The Mikado</i> has never lost its tremendous popularity. For
<i>The Mikado</i> represents Gilbert and Sullivan at their creative peak.
The whimsical characters, absurd situations, the savage malice of the
wit and satire, and the strange and paradoxical deviations of the plot
find Gilbert at the height of his whimsical imagination and skill; and at
every turn, Sullivan was there with music that captured every subtle
echo of Gilbert&rsquo;s fancy.</p>
<p>The thought of having to marry the unattractive Katisha proves so
distasteful to Nanki-Poo, son of the Mikado, that he puts on the disguise
of a wandering minstrel and flees. After coming to the town of
Titipu, he meets and falls in love with Yum-Yum who, in turn, is being
sought after by her own guardian, Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner.
The Lord High Executioner faces a major problem. The ruler of Japan
has sent a message to Titipu stating that since no execution has taken
place there for many years the office of Lord High Executioner will be
abolished if somebody is not executed shortly. When Ko-Ko discovers
that Nanki-Poo is about to commit suicide, rather than live without
Yum-Yum, he finds a solution to his own problem. Ko-Ko is willing to
allow Nanki-Poo to marry Yum-Yum and live with her for a month if
at the end of that time he allows himself to be beheaded. The wedding
takes place, but before the beheading can be consummated the Mikado
arrives on the scene with Katisha. Only then is the discovery made in
Titipu that Nanki-Poo is the Mikado&rsquo;s son and that anyone responsible
for his death must boil in oil. The news that Nanki-Poo is alive saves
Ko-Ko from this terrible fate; but he soon confronts another in the
form of Katisha, whom he must now marry to compensate her for her
loss of Nanki-Poo.</p>
<p>Many of the excerpts from <i>The Mikado</i> are known to anyone who
has ever heard or whistled a tune. These are the most significant: the
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
opening chorus of the Japanese nobles, &ldquo;If You Want to Know Who
We Are&rdquo;; Nanki-Poo&rsquo;s self-introductory ballad, &ldquo;A Wandering Minstrel
I&rdquo;; Pish-Tush&rsquo;s description of the Mikado&rsquo;s decree against flirtation,
&ldquo;Our Great Mikado&rdquo;; Ko-Ko&rsquo;s famous patter song, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Got a
Little List&rdquo;; the song of Yum-Yum&rsquo;s companions, &ldquo;Three Little Maids&rdquo;;
the affecting duet of Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum, &ldquo;Were You Not to Ko-Ko
Plighted&rdquo;; Yum-Yum&rsquo;s radiant song, &ldquo;The Sun Whose Rays&rdquo;; Ko-Ko&rsquo;s
allegorical song, &ldquo;Tit Willow&rdquo;; the madrigal of Yum-Yum, Pitti
Sing, Nanki-Poo and Pish Tush, &ldquo;Brightly Dawns Our Wedding Day&rdquo;;
the sprightly trio of Yum-Yum, Nanki-Poo and Ko-Ko, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a How-de-do&rdquo;;
the song of the Mikado, &ldquo;My Object All Sublime&rdquo;; the duet of
Nanki-Poo and Ko-Ko, &ldquo;The Flowers That Bloom in the Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Patience</i> in 1881 directed its well aimed satirical pricks and barbs at
the pre-Raphaelite movement in England with its fetish for simplicity
and naturalness; and with equal accuracy at poets and esthetes like
Oscar Wilde and Algernon Swinburne, leaders of an esthetic movement
that encouraged postures, poses, and pretenses. Twenty maidens are
turned into esthetes through their common love for the &ldquo;fleshly poet&rdquo;
Bunthorne. Because of this love they hold in disdain their former sweethearts,
the officers of the Heavy Dragoon. Bunthorne, however, is in
love with the simple, unselfish milkmaid Patience, who dotes after the
idyllic poet of heavenly beauty, Grosvenor. Since Patience is unselfish
she cannot hope to win Grosvenor&rsquo;s love, for to be loved by one so
beautiful is the most selfish thing in the world. She decides to accept
Bunthorne. Now the twenty love-sick maidens fall in love with Grosvenor
and through his influence abandon estheticism for simplicity. Unaware
of this new direction in their loved ones, the Dragoons desert
their uniforms for esthetic garb, substitute their former practical everyday
behavior for extravagant postures and poses. Weary of the demands
made upon him by the doting maids, Grosvenor (with a push from
Bunthorne) becomes commonplace. But, unfortunately for Bunthorne,
since it is no longer selfish to be loved by a commonplace man, Patience
returns to Grosvenor. The maidens, now interested in the commonplace,
can now return to their Dragoons. But poor Bunthorne is left
alone with nothing but a lily in his hand to console him.</p>
<p>The following are the principal selections from <i>Patience</i>: the opening
female chorus, &ldquo;Twenty Lovesick Maidens We&rdquo;; Patience&rsquo;s simple
query about the nature of love, &ldquo;I Cannot Tell What This Love May
Be&rdquo;; the chorus of the Dragoons, &ldquo;The Soldiers of Our Queen&rdquo; followed
immediately by the Colonel&rsquo;s patter song, &ldquo;If You Want a Receipt&rdquo;;
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
Bunthorne&rsquo;s recipe for success in the business of being an
esthete, &ldquo;If You&rsquo;re Anxious For to Shine&rdquo;; Grosvenor&rsquo;s duet with Patience,
&ldquo;Prithee, Pretty Maiden&rdquo;; Jane&rsquo;s soliloquy, &ldquo;Silvered is the
Raven Hair&rdquo; with which the second act opens; Grosvenor&rsquo;s fable to the
lovesick maidens, &ldquo;The Magnet and the Churn&rdquo;; Patience&rsquo;s ballad,
&ldquo;Love is a Plaintive Song&rdquo;; and the gay duet of Bunthorne and Grosvenor,
&ldquo;When I Go Out of Doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Pinafore</i> was the first of the successful Gilbert and Sullivan comic
operas in which we encounter that strange topsy-turvy world over
which Gilbert and Sullivan ruled; that we confront the accidents, coincidences,
paradoxes, and mishaps that beset its hapless inhabitants.
<i>Pinafore</i> is a devastating satire on the Admiralty in general and William
H. Smith, its First Lord, in particular. But it also makes a mockery
of social position. Ralph Rackstraw, a humble seaman, is in love with
Josephine, daughter of Captain Corcoran, commanding officer of the
<i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>. But the first Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Joseph Porter,
is also in love with her. Since Josephine&rsquo;s father would never consent
to have his daughter marry one so lowly as Ralph, the lovers decide to
elope. But the plans are overheard by the seaman, Dick Deadeye, who
reports them to the Captain with the result that Ralph is put in irons.
An impasse is thus reached until Little Buttercup, a &ldquo;Portsmouth
Bumboat woman,&rdquo; reveals an incident of the distant past. Entrusted
the care of two infants she mixed them up with the result that the
lowly born child, Corcoran, was mistaken for the one of high station
and was thus able to rise to the station of Captain; but the child of high
station believed to have been of lowly origin, Ralph, had been forced
to become a seaman. By order of Sir Joseph, Ralph now becomes the
master of the ship and can claim Josephine as his bride. The proud
Captain, now reduced to a seaman, must content himself with Little
Buttercup.</p>
<p><i>Pinafore</i> was a sensation when introduced in London in 1878, enjoying
seven hundred consecutive performances. But it proved even more
sensational in the United States, following its premi&egrave;re there at the
Boston Museum on November 25 of the same year. Ninety different
companies presented this comic opera throughout the country in that
first season, with five different companies operating simultaneously in
New York. <i>Pinafore</i> was given by colored groups, children&rsquo;s groups, and
religious groups. It was widely parodied. Some of its catch phrases
(&ldquo;What never? No never!&rdquo; and &ldquo;For he himself has said it&rdquo;) entered
American <i>argot</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>As a bountiful source of popular melodies, the score of <i>Pinafore</i> is
second only in importance to that of <i>The Mikado</i>. Here are the main
ones: the opening chorus of the sailors, &ldquo;We Sail the Ocean Blue&rdquo;;
Buttercup&rsquo;s forthright self-introduction, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Called Little Buttercup&rdquo;;
Ralph&rsquo;s madrigal, &ldquo;The Nightingale,&rdquo; and ballad, &ldquo;A Maiden Fair to
See&rdquo;; the Captain&rsquo;s colloquy with his crew, &ldquo;I Am the Captain of the
<i>Pinafore</i>&rdquo;; Josephine&rsquo;s poignant ballad, &ldquo;Sorry Her Lot&rdquo;; Sir Joseph&rsquo;s
exchange with his sisters, cousins, and aunts, &ldquo;I am the Monarch of the
Sea,&rdquo; and his autobiographical, &ldquo;When I Was a Lad&rdquo;; the Captain&rsquo;s sad
reflection, &ldquo;Fair Moon to Thee I Sing&rdquo;; the choral episode, &ldquo;Carefully
on Tip-Toe Stealing&rdquo; followed by the tongue-in-the-cheek paean to
England and Englishmen, &ldquo;He Is an Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> was the only Gilbert and Sullivan comic
opera to receive its world premi&egrave;re outside England. This took place
in New York at the Fifth Avenue Theater in 1879. (There was a single
hastily prepared performance in Paignton, England, on December 30,
1879 but this is not regarded as an official premi&egrave;re.) The reason why
<i>The Pirates</i> was introduced in New York was due to the presence there
of its authors. Numerous pirated versions of <i>Pinafore</i> were then being
given throughout the United States in about a hundred theaters, and
Gilbert and Sullivan decided to come to America for the dual purpose
of exploring the conditions under which they might protect their copyright
and to offer an authorized version of their opera. In coming to the
United States, they brought with them the manuscript of their new
work, <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, and arranged to have its premi&egrave;re take
place in New York.</p>
<p><i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> is a blood relative of <i>Pinafore</i>. Where <i>Pinafore</i>
made fun of the British Navy, <i>The Pirates</i> concentrates on the
British Army and constabulary. In <i>Pinafore</i> two babies are mixed up in
the cradle for a confusion of their identities; in <i>The Pirates</i> it is the
future professions of babies which are confounded in the cradle. In
<i>Pinafore</i> the secret is divulged by Buttercup, in <i>The Pirates</i> by Ruth.
<i>Pinafore</i> boasts a female chorus of cousins, sisters and aunts while <i>The
Pirates</i> has a female chorus made up of the Major General&rsquo;s daughters.</p>
<p>The hero is young Frederic, apprenticed to a band of pirates by his
nurse Ruth, who mistakes the word &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; for &ldquo;pirate.&rdquo; Frederic falls
in love with Mabel, one of the many daughters of Major General Stanley
and looks forward eagerly to his freedom from his apprenticeship
to the pirate band, which arrives on his twenty-first birthday. But Frederic
discovers that since he was born on leap year the year of his freedom&mdash;his
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
twenty-first <i>birthday</i>&mdash;is many, many years off; that by the
calendar he is still only a little boy of five. As a pirate he must join his
confederates in exterminating Mabel&rsquo;s father and the constables attending
him. But all turns out happily when the pirates actually prove to
be ex-noblemen, and are thus found highly acceptable as husbands for
the daughters of Major General Stanley. The Major General is also
in favor of the union of Mabel and Frederic.</p>
<p>The following are the leading musical selections: the opening chorus
of the pirates, &ldquo;Pour, Oh Pour, the Pirate Sherry&rdquo;; the Pirate king&rsquo;s
hymn to his profession, &ldquo;For I am a Pirate King&rdquo;; the chorus of the
Major General&rsquo;s daughters, &ldquo;Climbing Over Rocky Mountain&rdquo;; Frederic&rsquo;s
plaintive plea for a lover, &ldquo;Oh, Is There Not One Maiden
Breast&rdquo;; the Major General&rsquo;s autobiographical patter song, &ldquo;I Am the
Very Pattern of a Modern Major General&rdquo;; the rousing chorus of the
constabulary, &ldquo;When the Foeman Bares His Steel&rdquo;; the tripping trio of
Ruth, Fred and the Pirate King on discovering Fred is only a child of
five, &ldquo;A Paradox, a Most Ingenious Paradox&rdquo;; Mabel&rsquo;s haunting ballad,
&ldquo;Oh, Leave Me Not to Pine&rdquo;; the Police Sergeant&rsquo;s commentary
on his profession, &ldquo;When a Felon&rsquo;s Not Engaged in His Employment&rdquo;;
the Pirates&rsquo; chorus, &ldquo;Come Friends Who Plough the Sea,&rdquo; a melody
expropriated by an American, Theodore Morse, for the lyric &ldquo;Hail,
Hail the Gang&rsquo;s All Here&rdquo;; and the General&rsquo;s idyllic ballad, &ldquo;Sighing
Softly To the River.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ruddigore</i>, a travesty on melodrama, was first performed on January
22, 1887. Because the Murgatroyd family has persecuted witches, an
evil spirit had fated it to commit a crime a day. Ruthven Murgatroyd
tries to flee from this curse by assuming the identity of simple Robin
Oakapple. He meets and falls in love with Rose who is being sought
after by Ruthven&rsquo;s foster brother, Richard. Since Ruthven as Robin
Oakapple has the upper hand with Rose, Richard avenges himself
by revealing the fact that his brother is really a member of the Murgatroyd
family and like all of them is the victim of the ancient family
curse. Back in his ancestral home, Ruthven must fulfil his quota of
crimes, a job he bungles so badly that his ancestors suddenly come alive
out of the picture frames on the wall, to condemn him. But after numerous
convolutions of typically Gilbertian logic and reasoning, the curse
is broken and Ruthven can live happily with his beloved Rose.</p>
<p>From <i>Ruddigore</i> come the following familiar sections: the opening
chorus of the bridesmaids, &ldquo;Fair Is Rose as the Bright May Day&rdquo;;
Hannah&rsquo;s legend, &ldquo;Sir Rupert Murgatroyd&rdquo;; Rose&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;If Somebody
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
There Chanced to Be&rdquo;; the extended duet of Robin and Rose,
&ldquo;I Know a Youth Who Loves a Little Maid&rdquo;; Richard&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;I
Shipped, D&rsquo;ye See, in a Revenue Sloop&rdquo;; Robin&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;My Boy You
May Take it From Me&rdquo;; the chorus of the bridesmaids, &ldquo;Hail the Bride
of Seventeen Summers&rdquo; followed by Rose&rsquo;s madrigal, &ldquo;Where the Buds
Are Blossoming&rdquo;; the duet of Robin and Adam, &ldquo;I Once Was As Meek
as a New Born Lamb&rdquo;; Rose&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;In Bygone Days&rdquo;; the chorus
of the family portraits, &ldquo;Painted Emblems of a Race&rdquo;; Sir Roderic&rsquo;s
patter song, &ldquo;When the Night Wind Howls&rdquo;; and Hannah&rsquo;s ballad,
&ldquo;There Grew a Little Flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Sorcerer</i>, the first successful Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera,
was introduced in 1877. Alexis, in love with Aline, wishes to spread
around the blessings of love. For this purpose he enlists the cooperation
of John Wellington Wells, the creator of a love brew. In an effort to
perpetuate Aline&rsquo;s love for him, Alexis has her drink this potion, only
to discover that his beloved has fallen for the vicar, Dr. Daly, he being
the first man she sees after drinking the draught. Since Alexis is not
the only one to suffer from this now-general epidemic of loving, a serious
effort must be made to offset the effects of this magic: a human sacrifice.
Naturally that sacrifice becomes none other than John Wellington
Wells who is driven to self immolation before things can once again be

<p>The music of <i>The Sorcerer</i> is not so well known as that of the other
famous comic operas, but it does contain several Gilbert and Sullivan
delights. Among them are: the song with which Wells introduces himself
and his black art, &ldquo;Oh! My Name Is John Wellington Wells,&rdquo; the
first of the Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs; the vicar&rsquo;s haunting ballad,
&ldquo;Time Was When Love and I Were Well Acquainted&rdquo;; and the
romantic duet of Aline and Alexis, &ldquo;It Is Not Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Yeomen of the Guard</i>, produced on October 3, 1888, the topsy-turvy
world of Gilbert and Sullivan is temporarily sidestepped for another
of operatic pretensions. Of all the Gilbert and Sullivan plays this
one comes closest to resembling an opera. The immediate stimulus for
the writing of the text came to Gilbert from an advertisement in a railway
station depicting a Beefeater. Out of this acorn grew the oak of
Gilbert&rsquo;s play in which Colonel Charles Fairfax is falsely accused by
his kinsman, Poltwhistle, of sorcery. For this he must be condemned to
death in the Tower of London. Since Fairfax is not married, his fortune
will pass on to his accuser. But Charles thwarts such evil designs by
marrying Elsie Maynard, a strolling player&mdash;if only for an hour. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
he manages to escape from the Tower disguised as a yeoman of the
guard. When the execution is to take place there is no victim. Eventually,
a reprieve enables Charles to live permanently with Elsie.</p>
<p>The most important selections from the <i>Yeomen of the Guard</i> are:
Phoebe&rsquo;s song with which the opera opens, &ldquo;When Maiden Loves&rdquo;; the
chorus of the yeomen, &ldquo;In the Autumn of Our Life&rdquo;; Fairfax&rsquo; ballad,
&ldquo;Is Life a Boon?&rdquo;; the extended duet of Point and Elsie, &ldquo;I Have a Song
to Sing, O&rdquo;; Phoebe&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;Were I Thy Bride&rdquo;; Point&rsquo;s patter song,
&ldquo;Oh, a Private Buffoon Is a Light-Hearted Loon&rdquo;; the quartet of Elsie,
Fairfax, Dame Carruthers and Meryll, &ldquo;Strange Adventure&rdquo;; the trio of
Fairfax, Elsie and Phoebe, &ldquo;A Man Who Would Woo a Fair Maid&rdquo;; the
quartet of Elsie, Fairfax, Phoebe and Point, &ldquo;When a Wooer Goes
a-Wooing&rdquo;; and the finale, &ldquo;Oh, Thoughtless Crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides his music for the comic operas there exists a vast repertory of
serious music by Sullivan. Of this hardly more than two songs have
retained their popularity. One is &ldquo;The Lost Chord,&rdquo; lyric by Adelaide
Proctor, written by Sullivan in December 1876 at the deathbed of his
brother, Fred. From Charles Willeby we get an account of how this
deeply moving piece of music came into being: &ldquo;For nearly three weeks
he watched by his bedside night and day. One night&mdash;the end was not
very far off then&mdash;while his sick brother had for a time fallen into a
peaceful sleep, and he was sitting as usual by the bedside, he chanced
to come across some verses by Adelaide Proctor with which he had
some five years previously been struck. He had then tried to set them
to music, but without satisfaction to himself. Now in the stillness of the
night he read them over again, and almost as he did so, he conceived
their musical equivalent. A stray sheet of music paper was at hand, and
he began to write. Slowly the music took shape, until, becoming quite
absorbed in it, he determined to finish the song. Even if in the cold
light of day it were to prove worthless, it would at least have helped to
while away the hours of watching. So he worked on at it. As he progressed,
he felt sure this was what he had sought for, and failed to find
on the occasion of his first attempt to set the words. In a short time it
was complete and not long after in the publisher&rsquo;s hands. Thus was
written &lsquo;The Lost Chord,&rsquo; perhaps the most successful song of modern
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onward Christian Soldiers,&rdquo; words by Sabine Baring-Gould, is the
most celebrated of Sullivan&rsquo;s more than fifty religious hymns. It is effective
not merely for its religious mood but also for its martial spirit.
&ldquo;The music,&rdquo; says Isaac Goldberg, &ldquo;has the tread of armies in it, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
broad diatonic stride.&rdquo; Sullivan wrote it in 1873 upon being appointed
editor of the <i>Hymnal</i>, a collection of hymns published by Novello for
the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge and the Hymnary.</p>
<h2 id="c169"><span class="small">Franz von <b id="g_Suppe">Supp&eacute;</b></span></h2>
<p>Franz von Supp&eacute; was born Francesco Supp&eacute;-Demelli in
Spalato, Yugoslavia, on April 18, 1819. He played the flute at eleven,
at thirteen started the study of harmony, and at fifteen completed a
Mass. Nevertheless, for a while he entertained the idea of becoming
either a physician or a teacher of Italian. When he finally decided upon
music as a profession he attended the Vienna Conservatory. After serving
an apprenticeship as conductor of operettas in Pressburg and Baden,
he was appointed principal conductor at Theater-an-der-Wien in
Vienna. In 1862 he assumed a similar post with the Karlstheater, and
from 1865 until his death at the Leopoldstadttheater. While absorbing
the influence and traditions of the op&eacute;ra-bouffe of Offenbach, he began
writing operettas of his own in a style uniquely his, setting and
establishing many of the traditions and clich&eacute;s which would henceforth
identify the Viennese operetta. He had an unusual gift for light, caressing
tunes, a gay and infectious spirit, and a direct emotional appeal.
His first operetta was <i>Jung lustig in alter traurig</i> in 1841. Success came
with his incidental music to <i>Poet and Peasant</i> (<i>Dichter und Bauer</i>),
introduced on August 24, 1846; its overture is still his best known composition
and a classic in the musical literature in a lighter vein. A succession
of popular operettas, over twenty-five in number, made him one
of Europe&rsquo;s most celebrated composers for the stage. His most famous
operettas were: <i>Das Maedchen vom Lande</i> (1847), <i>Die schoene Galatea</i>,
or <i>Beautiful Galathea</i> (1865), <i>Leichte Cavallerie</i>, or <i>Light Cavalry</i>
(1866), <i>Fatinitza</i> (1876), <i>Boccaccio</i> (1879), and <i>Donna Juanita</i> (1880).
Supp&eacute; died in Vienna on May 21, 1895.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>The overture to <i>The Beautiful Galathea</i> (<i>Die schoene Galatea</i>) opens
with brisk music. Horns and woodwind lead into an extended portrayal
of exaltated character by strings. Once again horns and woodwind appear,
this time providing a transition to a caressing melody that soon develops
into a fulsome song. After a theatrical passage, the overture&rsquo;s main
melody is heard in the strings, with harmonies filled in by the woodwind;
this is a graceful dance tune which, towards the end of the overture,
is repeated with harmonic and tonal amplitude by the full
orchestra.</p>
<p>The <i>Light Cavalry</i> Overture (<i>Leichte Cavallerie</i>) is, as its name indicates,
stirring music of martial character. Horn calls and forceful chords
in full orchestra provide at once the military character of this music.
A vivacious tune for the violins follows this forceful introduction after
which comes the brisk melody for woodwind followed by the full orchestra
that has made this overture so famous; the gallop of the cavalry
is here simulated in a brisk rhythm. The agitation is dissipated by a
sensitive transition in strings and clarinet to a spacious melody in strings
in a sensual Hungarian style. The brisk military music and the open
horning calls then give the overture a dynamic conclusion.</p>
<p><i>Morning, Noon and Night in Vienna</i> (<i>Ein Morgen, ein Mittag, ein
Abend in Wien</i>) is one of the composer&rsquo;s famous concert overtures. A
dramatic introduction&mdash;with forceful chords in full orchestra&mdash;leads to
a beautiful and fully realized song for solo cello against plucked strings,
one of Supp&eacute;&rsquo;s most inspired flights of melody. The song ended, the
dramatic opening is recalled to serve as a transition to two buoyant and
graceful Viennese tunes in the strings, the second repeated vigorously
and amplified by full orchestra. The overture ends in a robust rather
than lyrical vein.</p>
<p>The <i>Pique Dame</i> (<i>Queen of Spades</i>) Overture begins with a murmuring
passage for strings that grows in volume and changes character before
an expressive melody unfolds in lower strings against an accompanying
figure borrowed from the opening passage. A vigorous interlude
of strong chords and a vigorous pronouncement by the brass lead
into the most famous theme of the composition, a vivacious and jaunty
melody for strings and woodwind. This subject is developed at some
length before a melodic episode is offered by the lower strings as a
preface to a soft, idyllic interlude for the woodwind. The conclusion
of the overture is in a vigorous manner with an energetic restatement
of earlier thematic material.</p>
<p>Of all the Supp&eacute; overtures, whether for the stage or the concert hall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
the most famous undoubtedly is the <i>Poet and Peasant</i> (<i>Dichter und
Bauer</i>). After a stately introduction there arrives a gentle song for the
strings. This is succeeded by a more robust theme. The main melody
of the overture is a pulsating melody in &#8540; time. Indicative of the enormous
popularity of this overture in all parts of the world is that it has
been adapted for almost sixty different combinations of instruments.</p>
<h2 id="c170"><span class="small">Johan <b id="g_Svendsen">Svendsen</b></span></h2>
<p>Johan Svendsen was born in Oslo, Norway, on September
30, 1840. The son of a bandmaster, he dabbled in music for many years
before receiving formal instruction. When he was twenty-three he
embarked for the first time on a comprehensive musical education by
attending the Leipzig Conservatory where he was a pupil of Ferdinand
David, Reinecke, and others. After that he toured Europe as a concert
violinist and lived for a while in Paris where he played in theater
orchestras. In 1870 he visited the United States where he married an
American woman whom he had originally met in Paris. Following his
return to his native land he was the conductor of the Christiana Musical
Association from 1872 to 1877 and again from 1880 to 1883. In 1883 he
settled in Copenhagen where for sixteen years he was court conductor,
and part of that time conductor at the Royal Theater as well. As a composer
Svendsen distinguished himself with major works for orchestra
in a pronounced Norwegian style, the most famous being four Norwegian
Rhapsodies and the <i>Carnaval des artistes norv&eacute;giens</i>, in all of
which Norwegian folk melodies are used extensively. He also produced
many works not of a national identity, among which were symphonies,
concertos, chamber-music works, and the highly popular <i>Carnival in
Paris</i>, for orchestra. Svendsen died in Copenhagen on June 14, 1911.</p>
<p><i>The Carnival in Paris</i> (<i>Carnaval &agrave; Paris</i>), for orchestra, op. 9 (1873)
is one of Svendsen&rsquo;s best-known works, even though it is not in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
characteristic Norwegian style. His early manhood in Paris had been
one of the composer&rsquo;s happiest experiences in life, and some of that joy
and feeling of excitement is found in this music describing a Mardi
Gras in Paris. The full orchestra enters after a swelling trumpet tone
over drum rolls. There is then heard an exchange among the wind instruments
and a quickening of the tempo to lead into the first main
theme, a delicate subject for flutes and clarinets. This theme is twice
repeated after which the music becomes stormy. Divided violins then
bring on the second theme, which like the first is quiet and gentle. In
the development, in which much is made of the first subject, there are
effective frequent alternations of tempo. A rhapsodic section, with a
subject for divided strings, followed by extended drum rolls and calls
for muted horns, precede the concluding section.</p>
<h2 id="c171"><span class="small">Deems <b id="g_Taylor">Taylor</b></span></h2>
<p>Joseph Deems Taylor was born in New York City on
December 22, 1885. He received his academic education in New York,
at the Friends School, Ethical Culture School, and New York University.
All the while he studied music with private teachers. Following his
graduation from college, Taylor appeared in vaudeville, worked for
several magazines, and from 1921 to 1925 was the music critic of the
New York <i>World</i>. He first distinguished himself as a composer in 1919
with the orchestral suite, <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>. In 1925 he resigned
from the <i>World</i> to concentrate on composition. In the next half
dozen years he completed two operas, each successfully performed at
the Metropolitan Opera: <i>The King&rsquo;s Henchman</i> (with libretto by Edna
St. Vincent Millay) in 1927, and <i>Peter Ibbetson</i> in 1931. Since 1927,
Taylor has followed several careers besides that of one of America&rsquo;s
most important serious composers. He was editor of <i>Musical America</i>,
music critic for the <i>New York American</i>, master of ceremonies on radio
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
and television, program annotator, intermission commentator for broadcasts
of opera and orchestral music, and author of several best-selling
books on music. A highly sophisticated composer with a consummate
technical skill, Taylor&rsquo;s works are not for popular consumption. But
he did write one composition in a popular style, <i>Circus Day</i>; and a second
of his works, <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, while intended for symphonic
concerts, has enough wit and charm to fall gracefully into the
semi-classical category.</p>
<p><i>Circus Day</i> is a fantasy for orchestra, op. 18 (1925) written on commission
from Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra. When Whiteman and
his orchestra introduced it that year, the work was orchestrated by
Ferde Grof&eacute;, but since then Taylor has prepared his own symphonic
adaptation. Subtitled &ldquo;eight pictures from memory&rdquo; this fantasy strives
&ldquo;to convey one&rsquo;s early impressions of a day at the circus.&rdquo; The composer
has provided his own program notes for the eight movements. The first,
entitled &ldquo;Street Parade,&rdquo; describes the circus parade as it &ldquo;passes on
down the street.&rdquo; &ldquo;The playing of the band grows fainter and dies away
in the distance.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Big Tops&rdquo; tells in musical terms about &ldquo;peanuts,
popcorn, pink lemonade, bawling side-show barkers.&rdquo; This is followed
by &ldquo;Bareback Riders.&rdquo; &ldquo;As the ringmaster cracks his whip, the riders
perform the miraculous feats ... that make horseback riders the
objects of such awe and admiration.&rdquo; The fourth movement is in three
parts. The first is devoted to &ldquo;The Lion&rsquo;s Cage.&rdquo; &ldquo;The roar of the lions
is blood curdling, but they go through their tricks with no damage
to any of us.&rdquo; The second speaks about &ldquo;The Dog and the Monkey
Circus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Into the ring dash a whole kennel full of small dogs guised as
race horses, ridden by monkeys dressed as jockeys.&rdquo; In the third, we get
a picture of &ldquo;The Waltzing Elephants.&rdquo; &ldquo;The great beasts solemnly
waltz to a tune that is a pachydermous version of the theme of the bareback
riders.&rdquo; In the fifth movement, &ldquo;Tight-Rope Walker,&rdquo; the performer
&ldquo;balances his parasol; he pirouettes and slips and slides as he
makes his perilous way along the taut wire.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jugglers,&rdquo; in the
sixth movement, &ldquo;juggle little balls and big ones, knives, dishes, hats,
lighted candles....&rdquo; Even the orchestra is seized by the contagion and
finally juggles its main theme, keeping three versions of it in the air. In
&ldquo;Clowns,&rdquo; two of them &ldquo;come out to play us a tune.... Finally, after
a furious argument, the entire clown band manages to play the tune
through, amid applause.&rdquo; The finale, the composer goes on to explain,
&ldquo;might better be called &lsquo;Looking Back.&rsquo; For the circus is over, and we
are back at home, trying to tell a slightly inattentive family what we
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
saw and heard. The helpful orchestra evokes recollections of jugglers,
clowns, bareback riders, tight-rope walkers, trained animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, a suite for orchestra (1919) is a musical
setting of episodes from Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s delightful tale of the same
name. Taylor&rsquo;s suite is in four movements, for which he has provided
his own program. The first movement, &ldquo;Dedication; The Garden of
Live Flowers,&rdquo; consists of &ldquo;a simple song theme, briefly developed,&rdquo;
which leads immediately to the brisk music of &ldquo;The Garden of Live
Flowers.&rdquo; In the second movement, &ldquo;Jabberwocky,&rdquo; the theme of the
frightful beast, the Jabberwock, &ldquo;is first announced by the full orchestra.
The clarinet then begins the tale [with] the battle with the monsters
recounted in a short and rather repellant fugue.&rdquo; The third movement,
&ldquo;Looking Glass Insects&rdquo; tells of &ldquo;the vociferous <i>diptera</i> that made such
an impression on Alice&mdash;the Bee-elephant, the Gnat, the Rockinghorse
fly, and the Bread-and-butter fly.&rdquo; The last movement, &ldquo;The White
Knight&rdquo; has two themes. &ldquo;The first is a sort of instrumental prance,
being the knight&rsquo;s own conception of himself as a slashing daredevil.
The second is bland, mellifluous, a little sentimental&mdash;much more like
the knight as he really was.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c172"><span class="small">Peter Ilitch <b id="g_Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</b></span></h2>
<p>Peter Ilitch Tchaikovsky was born in Votkinsk,
Russia, on May 7, 1840. Serious music study began comparatively
late, since he prepared for a career in law and then for three years
served as clerk in the Ministry of Justice. He had, however, revealed
unusual sensitivity for music from earliest childhood, and had received
some training on the piano from the time he was five. Intensive music
study, however, did not begin until 1861 when he became a pupil of
Nicholas Zaremba, and it was completed at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.
His professional career began in 1865, the year in which he was
appointed professor of harmony at the newly founded Moscow Conservatory.
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
This was also the year when one of his compositions was
performed for the first time: <i>Characteristic Dances</i>, for orchestra, introduced
by Johann Strauss II in Pavlovsk, Russia. Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s first
symphony was introduced in Moscow in 1868; his first opera, <i>The
Voivoda</i>, in Moscow in 1869; and his first masterwork&mdash;the orchestral
fantasy <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>&mdash;in Moscow in 1870. During the next half
dozen years he reached maturity as composer with the completion of
his second and third symphonies, first two string quartets, famous Piano
Concerto No. 1, and the orchestral fantasy, <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>.</p>
<p>In 1877, Tchaikovsky embarked precipitously on a disastrous marriage
with Antonina Miliukova. He did not love her, but was flattered
by her adoration of his music. In all probability he regarded this marriage
as a convenient cloak with which to conceal his sexual aberration
which was already causing some talk in Moscow and of which he was
heartily ashamed. In any event, this marriage proved a nightmare from
the beginning. Always hypersensitive, he now became a victim of mental
torment which led him to try suicide. Failing that, he fled from his
wife to find refuge in his brother&rsquo;s house where he collapsed physically.
For a year after that he traveled about aimlessly in Europe.</p>
<p>This strange relationship with his wife was followed by another one,
even more curious and unorthodox, with the woman whom he admired
and loved above all others. She was the wealthy patroness and widow,
Nadezhda von Meck, with whom he maintained a friendship lasting
thirteen years. But during all that time he never once met her personally,
their friendship being developed through an exchange of often
tender at times even passionate letters. She had written him to speak
of her admiration for his music and he had replied in gratitude. Before
long, she endowed him with a generous annual subsidy to allow him
full freedom to write music. From then on, they wrote each other frequently,
with Tchaikovsky often baring his heart and soul. The reason
why they never met was that Mme. von Meck had firmly established
that condition for the continuation of their friendship and her financial
generosity. Why this strange request was made, and why she adhered to
it so tenaciously, has never been adequately explained. She may have
been influenced by their different stations in life, or by her excessive
devotion to her children, or even by a knowledge of the composer&rsquo;s
sexual deviation.</p>
<p>Now financially independent&mdash;and strengthened by the kindness, affection
and sympathy of his patroness&mdash;Tchaikovsky entered upon one of
his richest creative periods by producing one masterwork after another:
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
the fourth and fifth symphonies, the opera, <i>Eugene Onegin</i>; the violin
concerto; the <i>Capriccio italien</i>, for orchestra; a library of wonderful
songs. Inevitably he now assumed a rank of first importance in Russian
music. In 1884 he was honored by the Czar with the Order of St. Vladimir,
and in 1888 a life pension was conferred upon him by the Russian
government.</p>
<p>In 1890, while traveling in the Caucasus, Tchaikovsky heard from
Mme. von Meck that she had recently suffered financial reverses and
was compelled to terminate her subsidy. The composer replied that he
was no longer in need of her financial help but that he hoped their
friendship might continue. To this, and to all subsequent letters by
Tchaikovsky, Mme. von Meck remained silent. Upon returning to Moscow,
Tchaikovsky discovered that his patroness was in no financial difficulties
whatsoever, but had used this as an excuse to terminate a relationship
of which she had grown weary. The loss of his dearest friend,
and the specious reason given for the termination of their relationship,
was an overwhelming blow, one largely responsible for the fits of
melancholia into which Tchaikovsky lapsed so frequently from this
time on.</p>
<p>In 1891, Tchaikovsky paid his only visit to the United States where
he helped open Carnegie Hall in New York by directing a performance
of his own <i>Overture 1812</i>. After returning to Russia, he became so
morbid, and succumbed so helplessly to fits of despair, that at times he
thought he was losing his mind. In such a mood he wrote his last symphony,
the <i>Path&eacute;tique</i>, one of the most tragic utterances in all music;
there is good reason to believe that when Tchaikovsky wrote this music
he was creating his own requiem. He died in St. Petersburg on November
6, 1893, a victim of cholera contracted when he drank a glass of
boiled water during an epidemic.</p>
<p>The qualities in his major serious works that made Tchaikovsky one
of the best loved and most frequently performed composers in the
world are also the traits that bring his lesser works into the permanent
semi-classical repertory: an endless fund of beautiful melody; an affecting
sentiment that at times lapses into sentimentality; a lack of inhibitions
in voicing his deepest emotions and most personal thoughts.</p>
<p>The <i>Andante Cantabile</i> is a gentle, melancholy song in three-part
form which comes from one of the composer&rsquo;s string quartets, in D
major, op. 11 (1871). This is the second movement of the quartet, and
the reason why this work as a whole is still occasionally performed. This
famous melody, however, is not original with the composer, but a
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
quotation of a Russian folk song, &ldquo;Vanya Sat on the Divan,&rdquo; which the
composer heard a baker sing in Kamenka, Russia. Tchaikovsky himself
adapted this music for orchestra. In 1941, this melody was adapted into
the American popular song, &ldquo;On the Isle of May.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Chanson Triste</i> is another of the composer&rsquo;s soft, gentle melodies that
is filled with sentiment. This is the second of twelve children&rsquo;s pieces for
the piano &ldquo;of moderate difficulty,&rdquo; op. 40 (1876-1877).</p>
<p><i>Humoresque</i>, op. 10, no. 2 (1871)&mdash;a &ldquo;humoresque&rdquo; being an instrumental
composition in a whimsical vein&mdash;finds Tchaikovsky in a less
familiar attitude, that of grotesquerie. This sprightly little tune is
almost as celebrated as the very popular <i>Humoresque</i> of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k; and
like that of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, it originated as a composition for the piano, a companion
to a <i>Nocturne</i> which it follows. Fritz Kreisler made a fine transcription
for violin and piano, while Stokowski was one of several to
adapt it for orchestra.</p>
<p>The <i>Marche Slav</i>, for orchestra, op. 31 (1876) was intended for a
benefit concert in St. Petersburg for Serbian soldiers wounded in the
war with Turkey. At that performance, the work aroused a &ldquo;whole
storm of patriotic enthusiasm,&rdquo; as the composer himself reported. The
work opens with a broad Slavic march melody which Tchaikovsky borrowed
from a Serbian folk song. The middle trio section is made up of
two other folk tunes. The composition ends with a triumphant restatement
of the opening march melody, now speaking for the victory of the
Serbs over the Turks.</p>
<p>The <i>Melodie</i>, in E-flat major, op. 42, no. 3 (1878) is a simple and
haunting little song that originated as a piece for violin and piano. It
appears in a set of three such pieces entitled <i>Souvenir d&rsquo;un lieu cher</i>,
of which it is the closing number. This melody was used in 1941 for the
American popular song, &ldquo;The Things I Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Months</i>, op. 37b (1876) is a suite for piano out of which come
several compositions exceedingly popular in transcriptions. Each movement
of this suite is devoted to a month of the year. The sixth movement
is <i>June</i>, a little barcarolle, or Venetian boat song. The tenth, for
October, is <i>Autumn Song</i>, a gentle melody lightly touched by sadness.
The eleventh, for November, is by contrast a lively piece entitled
<i>Troika en Traneaux</i>, or <i>The Troika</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None But the Lonely Heart&rdquo; is one of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s most famous
songs, a melancholy setting of Goethe&rsquo;s poem. This is the last of a set of
six songs, op. 16 (1872) which is extensively performed in transcriptions
of all sorts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>The <i>Nutcracker Suite</i>, or <i>Casse-Noisette</i>, op. 71a (1892) is a suite for
orchestra adapted from a ballet score. The ballet (introduced in St.
Petersburg in 1892) tells about a nutcracker, received as a Christmas
gift by a little girl, which in her dreams becomes a handsome prince.
He leads toys into battle against mice, and conducts the little girl to
Jam Mountain, Arabia, where she is delighted with all kinds of games
and dances. Those accustomed to associate the name of Tchaikovsky
with lugubrious music will find this suite a revelation, for it is filled
with the most enchanting moods, and is consistently light of heart and
spirit. The highly popular suite for orchestra is made up of eight little
movements. &ldquo;Miniature Overture&rdquo; is built from two lively tunes. The
main subject of the &ldquo;March&rdquo; is a pert melody for clarinet, horn, and
two trumpets; the trio section consists of a vivacious staccato melody
for the woodwind and strings. &ldquo;The Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy&rdquo; is
a sensitive melody for the celesta, the &ldquo;Trepak&rdquo; is a vigorous, rhythmic
Russian dance, the &ldquo;Arabian Dance&rdquo; is an exotic melody for the clarinet,
and the &ldquo;Chinese Dance&rdquo; an Oriental subject for flute and piccolo.
The two last movements are the &ldquo;Dance of the Flutes&rdquo; in which a sensitive
melody for flutes is contrasted by a more robust section for trumpets,
and the &ldquo;Waltz of the Flowers,&rdquo; where the waltz tune in horns and
then in clarinets is followed by two more important ideas, the first in
the strings, and the second in flutes and oboe.</p>
<p>The <i>Overture 1812</i> is a concert overture for orchestra, op. 49 (1880)
commissioned for the consecration of a temple built as a memorial to
Napoleon&rsquo;s defeat in Russia in 1812. This overture was intended by the
composer to describe the historic events of Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of and
flight from Russia. An introductory section quotes the well-known
Russian hymn, &ldquo;God Preserve Thy People.&rdquo; In the main body of the
overture, the Battle of Borodino is dramatically depicted, the two opposing
armies represented by quotations from the <i>Marseillaise</i> and the
Russian national anthem. A climax is reached with a triumphant restatement
of the Russian national anthem.</p>
<p>The <i>Polonaise</i> is one of two celebrated dance episodes in the opera
<i>Eugene Onegin</i>. (The other is the Waltz discussed below.) This three-act
opera is based on a poem by Pushkin, adapted by Konstantin Shilovsky
and the composer himself, and was introduced in Moscow on March
29, 1879. The setting is St. Petersburg in or about 1815, and its central
theme concerns the frustrated love affair of Eugene Onegin and Tatiana.
The brilliant music of the Polonaise is heard in the first scene of
Act 3. In the palace of Prince Gremin there takes place a reception
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
during which the guests dance to the vital strains of this courtly Polish
dance, its vigor derived from sharp syncopations and accents on the
half beat.</p>
<p><i>Romance</i>, in F minor, op. 5 (1868) is a composition for piano written
by the composer when he believed himself in love with the singer,
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Art&ocirc;t, to whom the piece is dedicated. This music gives voice
to a romantic ardor.</p>
<p>The <i>S&eacute;r&eacute;nade m&eacute;lancolique</i> in B-flat minor, op. 26 (1875) is a work
for violin and orchestra. As the title indicates it is a sentimental rather
than romantic effusion. Here a brief subject leads to a soaring three-part
song for the violin.</p>
<p><i>Serenade for Strings</i>, in C major, op. 48 (1880) is particularly famous
for its second and third movements. The second is a Waltz, perhaps the
most popular of this composer&rsquo;s many well loved waltzes. This is a
graceful, even elegant, dance movement, the waltz of the Parisian salon
rather than the more vital and earthy dance of Vienna. Such a light-hearted
mood is instantly dispelled by the gloom of the third movement,
an eloquent <i>Elegy</i>, in which the sorrow is all the more poignant
because it is so subdued and restrained.</p>
<p>Solitude, op. 73, no. 6 (1893)&mdash;sometimes known as Again as Before&mdash;is
a song set to a poem by D. M. Rathaus. This is the last of a set of
six songs. Stokowski made an effective arrangement for orchestra.</p>
<p><i>Song Without Words</i> (<i>Chanson sans paroles</i>), in F major is the third
of a set of three pieces for the piano collectively entitled <i>Souvenir de
Hapsal</i>, op. 2 (1867). This tender melody is far more familiar in transcriptions
than it is in its original version.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky wrote three Suites for orchestra. From two of these come
movements which must be counted with the composer&rsquo;s most popular
works. The Suite No. 1 in D minor, op. 43 (1880) is famous for its
fourth movement, a <i>Marche Miniature</i>. The inclusion of this section
into the suite was something of an afterthought with the composer,
since it was interpolated into the work only after it had been published,
placed as a fourth movement between an intermezzo and a scherzo.
This march is in the grotesque, fantastic style of the piano <i>Humoresque</i>.
The main subject is heard in the piccolo against plucked-string accompaniment.
A transitory episode in strings and bells leads to a development
of this melody.</p>
<p>The third movement from this same suite, <i>Intermezzo</i>, has two main
melodies: the first appears in first violins, violas, bassoons and flute; the
second, in cellos and bassoon. The coda is based on the first theme.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>The suite No. 3 in G major, op. 55 (1884) is a four-movement work of
which the second is particularly celebrated. This is a <i>Valse m&eacute;lancolique</i>
for full orchestra, highly expressive and emotional music in the
composer&rsquo;s identifiable sentimental style.</p>
<p>There are several other waltzes by Tchaikovsky familiar to all lovers
of light music. The <i>Valse sentimentale</i>, op. 51, no. 6 comes from a set
of six pieces for the piano (1882) where it is the final number. The
opera <i>Eugene Onegin</i> (commented upon above for its Polonaise) is also
the source of a remarkable waltz episode. This music, the essence of
aristocratic style and elegance, appears in the first scene of the second
act. Tatiana&rsquo;s birthday is celebrated with a festive party during which
the guests dance to its infectious strains. Two other famous Tchaikovsky
waltzes come from his famous ballets&mdash;<i>Sleeping Beauty</i> and <i>Swan
Lake</i>. In the orchestral suite derived from the score of <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>,
the waltz appears as the fourth and concluding movement and consists
of a lilting melody for strings which is carried to an overpowering
climax. The <i>Swan Lake</i> consists of thirty-three numbers, various combinations
of its most popular sections serving as orchestral suites for
concert performance. The suave waltz music serves in the ballet for a
dance of the swans at the lakeside in the second act.</p>
<h2 id="c173"><span class="small">Ambroise <b id="g_Thomas">Thomas</b></span></h2>
<p>Ambroise Thomas was born in Metz, France, on August
5, 1811. Between 1828 and 1832 he attended the Paris Conservatory
where he won numerous prizes including the Prix de Rome. After his
three-year stay in Rome, where he wrote some orchestral and chamber
music, he returned to Paris in 1836 and devoted himself to writing
operas. The first was <i>La double &eacute;chelle</i>, produced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique
in 1837. His first success was realized in 1843 with <i>Mina</i>, and
in 1866 the opera by which he is remembered, <i>Mignon</i>, was triumphantly
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
introduced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique. Later operas included <i>Hamlet</i>
(1868) and <i>Fran&ccedil;oise de Rimini</i> (1882). In 1851, Thomas was elected
member of the French Academy. In 1871 he was appointed director of
the Paris Conservatory, and in 1894 he was the recipient of the Grand
Cross of the Legion of Honor. He died in Paris on February 12, 1896.</p>
<p><i>Mignon</i> represents the French lyric theater at its best, with its graceful
melodies, charming moods, and courtly grace of style. Its world premi&egrave;re
took place at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique on November 17, 1866. In less
than a century it was given over two thousand performances by that
company besides becoming a staple in the repertory of opera houses the
world over. The opera is based on Goethe&rsquo;s novel, <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>,
adapted by Michel Carr&eacute; and Jules Barbier. Mignon is a gypsy girl purchased
by Wilhelm Meister. She falls in love with him and is heartbroken
to discover how he is attracted to the actress, Philine. She tells
the demented Lothario of her sorrow and of her wish that Meister&rsquo;s
castle be burned to the ground. Lothario then proceeds to set Meister&rsquo;s
castle aflame. Mignon, caught therein, is saved by Meister and then
gently nursed back to health. Meister now realizes he is in love with her
and her alone. When the demented Lothario regains his sanity we learn
that Mignon is in actuality his daughter and that the castle he has
burned is not Meister&rsquo;s but his own.</p>
<p>Parts of this opera are better known than the whole, and through
these parts <i>Mignon</i> remains deservedly popular on semi-classical programs.
The Overture makes extended use of two of the opera&rsquo;s main
melodies. The first is &ldquo;<i>Connais-tu le pays</i>,&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Knowest Thou the
Land?</i>&rdquo;), Mignon&rsquo;s poignant first-act aria in which she recalls her childhood
in some distant land; the melody is given in the wind instruments
after a brief introduction. The second aria is Philine&rsquo;s polonaise, &ldquo;<i>Je
suis Titania</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>I am Titania</i>&rdquo;) from the second scene of the second act.</p>
<p>Another delightful orchestral episode from this opera is a suave,
graceful little gavotte heard as entr&rsquo;acte music just before the rise of the
second-act curtain.</p>
<p>The <i>Raymond</i> Overture is even more popular than that to <i>Mignon</i>.
<i>Raymond</i> was first performed at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique on June 5, 1851.
The overture opens with a spirited section punctuated with dashing
chords. A serene transition, highlighted by a passage for solo cello, brings
on a light, tuneful air in the violins against sharply accented plucked
strings; a graceful countermelody for the woodwind follows. This appealing
material is repeated at some length with embellishments and
amplifications until a new thought is asserted: a brisk, march-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
melody that slowly gains in sonority and tempo until a climactic point
is reached in which this march melody is forcefully given by the full
orchestra. The strings then offer a sentimental melody by way of temporary
relief. But the overture ends in a dramatic and spirited mood
with a finale statement of the march tune.</p>
<h2 id="c174"><span class="small">Enrico <b id="g_Toselli">Toselli</b></span></h2>
<p>Enrico Toselli was born in Florence, Italy, on March 13,
1883. After studying with Sgambati and Martucci, Toselli toured
Italy as a concert pianist. But he achieved renown not on the concert
stage but with the writing of several romantic songs. One of these is the
&ldquo;<i>Serenata</i>,&rdquo; No. 1, op. 6, through which his name survives. He also wrote
some orchestral music and an operetta, <i>La Principessa bizzarra</i> (1913)
whose libretto was the work of the former Crown Princess Luisa of
Saxony whom he married in 1907 thereby creating an international
sensation. Toselli died in Florence, Italy, on January 15, 1926.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<i>Serenata</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Rimpianto</i>&rdquo;) with Italian words by Alfred Silvestri
and English lyrics by Sigmund Spaeth was published in the United States
in 1923. This romantic, sentimental, Italian melody, as well loved in
this country as in Europe, was for many years used by Gertrude Berg
as the theme music for her radio and television program, <i>The Goldbergs</i>.
It was also used as the theme music for an early talking picture,
<i>The Magic Flame</i>, in which Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky were
starred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<h2 id="c175"><span class="small">Sir Paolo <b id="g_Tosti">Tosti</b></span></h2>
<p>Sir Francesco Paolo Tosti, one of Italy&rsquo;s best
known song composers, was born in Ortona sul Mare, Abruzzi, Italy, on
April 9, 1846. His musical education took place at the Royal College
of San Pietro a Maiella in Naples. He left Naples in 1869 after serving
for a while as teacher of music. Returning to his native city he now
initiated his career as a composer of songs. Though a few of these early
efforts became popular he failed for a long time to find a publisher.
Success first came to him in Rome at a song recital in which he featured
some of his own compositions. He scored an even greater success as
singer-composer in London in 1875. He now settled permanently in
London, serving as a singing master to the royal family, and as professor
of singing at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1908 he was knighted. In
1913 he returned to his native land. He died in Rome on December 2,
1916.</p>
<p>Tosti had a remarkable lyric gift that was Italian to its very core in
the ease, fluidity, and singableness of his melodies. This talent was combined
with an elegant style and a sincere emotion. His best songs are
among the most popular to emerge from Italy. The most famous and
the most moving emotionally is without question &ldquo;<i>Addio</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Goodbye,
Forever&rdquo;). Almost as popular and appealing are &ldquo;<i>Ideale</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;My Ideal&rdquo;),
&ldquo;<i>Marechiare</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Mattinata</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Segreto</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>La Serenata</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Vorrei
morire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_326">326</div>
<h2 id="c176"><span class="small">Giuseppe <b id="g_Verdi">Verdi</b></span></h2>
<p>Giuseppe Verdi, the greatest of the Italian opera composers,
was born in Le Roncole, Italy, on October 10, 1813. He demonstrated
such unmistakable gifts for music in his boyhood that his townspeople
created a fund to send him to the Milan Conservatory. In 1832
he appeared in Milan. Finding he was too old to gain admission to the
Conservatory, he studied composition privately with Vincenzo Lavigna.
For several years Verdi lived in Busseto where he conducted the Philharmonic
Society and wrote his first opera, <i>Oberto</i>, produced in Milan
in 1839. Now settled in Milan, he continued writing operas, achieving
his first major success with <i>Nabucco</i> in 1842. During the next eight
years he solidified his position as one of Italy&rsquo;s best loved opera composers
with several important works among which were <i>Ernani</i> (1844),
<i>Macbeth</i> (1847) and <i>Luisa Miller</i> (1849). A new era began for Verdi in
1851 with <i>Rigoletto</i>, an era in which he became Italy&rsquo;s greatest master
of opera, and one of the foremost in the world. <i>Il Trovatore</i> and <i>La
Traviata</i> came in 1853, to be followed by <i>I Vespri Siciliani</i> (1855),
<i>Simone Boccanegra</i> (1857), <i>Un ballo in maschera</i> (1859), <i>La Forza del
destino</i> (1862), and <i>Aida</i> (1871). Now a man of considerable wealth (as
well as fame), Verdi bought a farm in Sant&rsquo; Agata where he henceforth
spent his summers; after the completion of <i>Aida</i>, he lived there most of
the time in comparative seclusion, tending to his crops, gardens, and
live stock. When Cavour initiated the first Italian parliament, Verdi
was elected deputy. But Verdi never liked politics, and soon withdrew
from the political arena; however, in 1874, he accepted the honorary
appointment of Senator from the King.</p>
<p>As a composer, Verdi remained silent for about fifteen years after
<i>Aida</i>. By the time the world became reconciled to the fact that Verdi&rsquo;s
life work was over, he emerged from this long period of withdrawal to
produce two operas now generally regarded as his crowning achievements:
<i>Otello</i> (1887) and <i>Falstaff</i> (1893). During the last years of his
life, Verdi lived in a Milan hotel. His sight and hearing began to deteriorate,
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
and just before his death&mdash;in Milan on January 27, 1901&mdash;he
suffered a paralytic stroke. His death was mourned by the entire nation.
A quarter of a million mourners crowded the streets to watch his bier
pass for its burial in the oratory of the Musicians Home in Milan&mdash;accompanied
by the stately music of a chorus from <i>Nabucco</i>, conducted
by Toscanini.</p>
<p>Verdi&rsquo;s profound knowledge of the theater and his strong dramatic
sense, combined with his virtually incomparable Italian lyricism, made
him one of the greatest composers for the musical theater of all time.
But it is his lyricism&mdash;with all its infinite charm and variety&mdash;that makes
so much of his writing so popular to so many in such widely scattered
areas of the world. Selections from his most famous operas are favorites
even with many who have never seen them on the stage, because their
emotional appeal is inescapable.</p>
<p><i>Aida</i> is an opera filled not only with some of the most wonderful
melodies to be found in Italian opera but also with scenes of pomp,
ceremony, with exotic attractions, and with episodes dynamic with dramatic
interest. This was the opera that brought Verdi&rsquo;s second creative
period to a rich culmination; and it is unquestionably one of the composer&rsquo;s
masterworks. He wrote it on a commission from the Egyptian
Khedive for ceremonies commemorating the opening of the Suez Canal.
However, Verdi took so long to complete his opera that it was not performed
in Cairo until about two years after the canal had been opened,
on December 24, 1871. The libretto&mdash;by Antonio Ghislanzoni&mdash;was
based on a plot by Mariette Bey. Radames, captain of the Egyptian
guard, is in love with Aida, the Ethiopian slave of Amneris. The latter,
daughter of the King of Egypt, is herself in love with Radames. When
an invading Ethiopian force comes to threaten Egypt, Radames becomes
the commander of the army and proves himself a hero. Lavish
festivities and ceremonies celebrate his victorious return, during which
the king of Egypt offers him the hand of Amneris as reward. But
Radames is still in love with Aida. Since Aida is actually the daughter
of the Ethiopian king, she manages to extract from Radames the secret
maneuvers of the Egyptian army, information enabling the Ethiopian
army to destroy the Egyptians. For this treachery, Radames is buried
alive; and Aida, still in love with him, comes within his tomb to die
with him.</p>
<p>The brief overture opens with a tender melody in violins suggesting
Aida. After an effective development we hear a somber and brooding
motive of the Priests of Isis, which soon receives contrapuntal treatment.
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
The Aida motive is dramatized, brought to a magnificent climax,
then allowed to subside.</p>
<p>The Ballet Music is famous for its brilliant harmonic and orchestral
colors, exotic melodies, and pulsating rhythms. In Act 2, Scene 1 there
takes place the <i>Dance of the Moorish Slaves</i>, an oriental dance performed
before Amneris by the Moorish boys. The <i>Ballabile</i> is another
oriental dance which appears in Act 2, Scene 2, performed by the dancing
girls during the celebration attending the arrival of the triumphant
Egyptian army headed by Radames. In this scene there is also heard the
stirring strains of the <i>Grand March</i>. This march begins softly but soon
gathers its strength and erupts with full force as the king, his attendants,
the Priests, the standard bearers, Amneris and her slaves appear in a brilliant
procession. The people raise a cry of praise to the king and their
Gods in &ldquo;<i>Gloria all&rsquo; Egitto</i>.&rdquo; After this comes the dramatic march music
to which the Egyptian troops, with Radames at their head, enter triumphantly
into the square and file proudly before their king.</p>
<p>Of the vocal excerpts the most famous is undoubtedly Radames&rsquo;
ecstatic song of love to Aida in the first act, first scene, &ldquo;<i>Celeste Aida</i>,&rdquo;
surely one of the most famous tenor arias in all opera. Two principal
arias for soprano are by Aida. The first is her exultant prayer that
Radames come back victorious from the war, &ldquo;<i>Ritorna vincitor</i>&rdquo; in
Act 1, Scene 1; the other, &ldquo;<i>O Patria mia</i>,&rdquo; in Act 3, is her poignant
recollection of her beloved homeland in Ethiopia. Amneris&rsquo; moving
aria in Act 2, Scene 1, &ldquo;<i>Vieni amor mio</i>&rdquo; where she thinks about her
beloved Radames, and the concluding scene of the opera in which
Radames and Aida bid the world farewell, &ldquo;<i>O terra, addio</i>&rdquo; are also
famous.</p>
<p><i>La Forza del destino</i> (<i>The Force of Destiny</i>) has a popular overture.
This opera was first performed in St. Petersburg, Russia on November
10, 1862&mdash;libretto by Francesco Piave based on a play by the Duke de
Riva. Leonora, daughter of the Marquis of Calatrava, is in love with
Don Alvaro, a nobleman of Inca origin. When they plan elopement,
Leonora&rsquo;s father intervenes and is accidentally killed in the ensuing
brawl. Leonora&rsquo;s brother, Don Carlo, swears to avenge this death by
killing Don Alvaro. On the field of battle, Don Alvaro saves Don
Carlo&rsquo;s life. Not recognizing Don Alvaro as his sworn enemy, Don Carlo
pledges eternal friendship; but upon discovering Don Alvaro&rsquo;s true
identity, he challenges him to a duel in which Don Carlo is wounded.
Aware that he has brought doom to two people closest and dearest to
his beloved Leonora, Don Alvaro seeks sanctuary in a monastery where
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
many years later he is found by Don Carlo. In the sword duel that follows,
Don Alvaro kills Don Carlo, whose last act is to plunge a fatal
knife into his sister&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>A trumpet blast, creating an ominous air of doom, opens the overture.
An air in a minor key then leads to a gentle song for strings; this
is Leonora&rsquo;s prayer for help and protection to the Virgin in the second
scene of the second act, &ldquo;<i>Madre pietosa</i>.&rdquo; A light pastoral tune, depicting
the Italian countryside in the third act, is now heard. Leonora&rsquo;s
song of prayer is now forcefully repeated by the full orchestra, after
which the overture ends robustly.</p>
<p><i>Rigoletto</i>, introduced in Venice on March 11, 1851, is based on the
Victor Hugo play, <i>Le Roi s&rsquo;amuse</i> adapted by Francesco Piave. Rigoletto
is the hunchbacked jester to the Duke of Mantua who jealously
guards his daughter, Gilda, from the world outside their home. Disguised
as a student, the Duke woos Gilda and wins her love. Since the
Duke&rsquo;s courtiers hate the jester, they conspire to abduct Gilda and
bring her to the ducal court to become the Duke&rsquo;s mistress. Distraught
at this turn of affairs, the jester vows to kill the Duke and hires a professional
assassin to perform this evil deed. But since his own sister loves
the Duke, the assassin decides to spare him and to kill a stranger instead.
The stranger proves to be none other than Gilda, disguised as a
man for a projected flight to Verona. The body is placed in a sack for
delivery to Rigoletto who, before he can get rid of the body, discovers
that it is that of his beloved daughter.</p>
<p>The following are the best loved and most widely performed excerpts
from this tuneful opera: the Ballata, &ldquo;<i>Questa o quella</i>&rdquo; from the first
act in which the Duke flippantly talks of love and his many conquests;
the graceful Minuet to which the courtiers dance during a party at the
Ducal palace in the same act; Gilda&rsquo;s famous coloratura aria, &ldquo;<i>Caro
nome</i>&rdquo; from the second act, in which she dreams about the &ldquo;student&rdquo;
with whom she has fallen in love; the light and capricious aria of the
Duke, &ldquo;<i>La donna &egrave; mobile</i>&rdquo; from the third act, in which the Duke
mockingly comments on fickle womanhood, and one of the most celebrated
tenor arias in the repertory; the quartet &ldquo;<i>Bella figlia dell&rsquo;
amore</i>&rdquo;&mdash;as celebrated an ensemble number as &ldquo;<i>La donna &egrave; mobile</i>&rdquo; is
as an aria&mdash;in which each of the four principal characters of the opera
(Gilda, Rigoletto, the Duke, and Maddalena) speaks of his or her inner
turmoil, doubts, and hatreds in the third act.</p>
<p><i>La Traviata</i> (<i>The Lost One</i>) is Francesco Maria Piave&rsquo;s adaptation of
Alexandre Dumas&rsquo; celebrated romance, <i>La Dame aux cam&eacute;lias</i>. Its
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
central theme is the tragic tale of the courtesan, Violetta, who falls in
love with and is loved by Alfredo Germont. After they live together for
a blissful period, Alfredo&rsquo;s father is instrumental in breaking up the
affair by convincing Violetta she must give up her lover for his own
good. She does so by feigning she has grown tired of him. Only too late
does Alfredo learn the truth; when he returns to Violetta, she is dying
of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The premi&egrave;re of <i>La Traviata</i> in Venice on March 6, 1853 was a dismal
failure. The public reacted unfavorably to a play it regarded
immoral, and to the sight of a healthy prima donna seemingly wasting
away with tuberculosis; it also resented the fact that the opera was given
in contemporary dress. At a revival, a year later in Venice, the opera was
performed in costume and settings of an earlier period. Profiting further
from a carefully prepared presentation, the opera now cast a spell
on its audience. From this point on, <i>La Traviata</i> went on to conquer
the opera world to become one of the most popular operas ever written.</p>
<p>The orchestral preludes to the first and third act are celebrated. The
Prelude to Act 1 begins softly and slowly with a poignant melody suggesting
Violetta&rsquo;s fatal sickness; this is followed by a broad, rich song
for the strings describing Violetta&rsquo;s expression of love for Alfredo. The
Prelude to Act 3 also begins with the sad, slow melody speaking of
Violetta&rsquo;s illness. The music then becomes expressive and tender to
point up the tragedy of her life; this prelude ends with a succession of
broken phrases as Violetta&rsquo;s life slowly ebbs away.</p>
<p>The following are the principal vocal selections from <i>La Traviata</i>:
the opening drinking song, or Brindisi (&ldquo;<i>Libiamo, libiamo</i>&rdquo;); Violetta&rsquo;s
world-famous aria, &ldquo;<i>Ah, fors &egrave; lui</i>&rdquo; in which she reveals her love for
Alfredo followed immediately by her determination to remain free and
pleasure-loving (&ldquo;<i>Sempre libera</i>&rdquo;) also in the first act; Alfredo&rsquo;s expression
of joy that Violetta has come to live with him, &ldquo;<i>De&rsquo; miei bollenti
spiriti</i>&rdquo; and the elder Germont&rsquo;s recollection of his happy home in the
Provence, &ldquo;<i>Di Provenza il mar</i>&rdquo; from the second act; Violetta&rsquo;s pathetic
farewell to the world, &ldquo;<i>Addio del passato</i>,&rdquo; and Alfredo&rsquo;s promise to the
dying Violetta to return together to their happy home near Paris,
&ldquo;<i>Parigi, o cara</i>&rdquo; from the fourth act.</p>
<p><i>Il Trovatore</i> (<i>The Troubadours</i>) is so full of familiar melodies that,
like a play of Shakespeare, it appears to be replete with &ldquo;quotations.&rdquo;
It was first performed in Rome on January 19, 1853. The libretto by
Salvatore Commarno, based on a play by Antonio Garcia Guti&eacute;rrez, is
complicated to a point of obscurity, and filled with coincidences and
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">331</span>
improbabilities; but this did not prevent Verdi from creating one of
his most melodious scores, an inexhaustible reservoir of unforgettable
arias and ensemble numbers. The story involves Count di Luna in a
frustrated love affair with Leonora; his rival is Manrico, an officer of a
rival army with whom Leonora is in love. The gypsy Azucena convinces
Manrico, her foster son, that Count di Luna had been responsible for
the death of Manrico&rsquo;s father, and incites him on to avenge that murder.
Later in the play, Azucena and Manrico are captured by Di Luna&rsquo;s
army. To help free Manrico, Leonora promises to marry the Count.
Rather than pay this price, Leonora takes poison and dies at Manrico&rsquo;s
feet. Manrico is now sentenced to be executed. After his death, Azucena,
half-crazed, reveals that Manrico is really Count di Luna&rsquo;s half
brother.</p>
<p>The long list of favorite selections from <i>Il Trovatore</i> includes the following:
Manrico&rsquo;s beautiful serenade to Leonora in Act 1, Scene 2,
&ldquo;<i>Deserto sulla terra</i>&rdquo;; Leonora&rsquo;s poignant recollections of a mysterious
admirer in the second scene, &ldquo;<i>Tacea la notte placida</i>&rdquo;; the ever popular
<i>Anvil Chorus</i> of the gypsies with which the second act opens, &ldquo;<i>Vedi! le
fosche</i>&rdquo;; Azucena&rsquo;s stirring recollection of the time long past when her
mother had been burned as a witch, &ldquo;<i>Stride la vampa</i>,&rdquo; and Count di
Luna&rsquo;s expression of love for Leonora, &ldquo;<i>Il balen</i>&rdquo; also in the second act;
in the third act, Manrico&rsquo;s dramatic aria, &ldquo;<i>Di quella pira</i>&rdquo; and the
rousing soldier&rsquo;s chorus of Manrico&rsquo;s troops, &ldquo;<i>Squilli, echeggi la tromba
guerriera</i>&rdquo;; Leonora&rsquo;s prayer for her beloved Manrico &ldquo;<i>D&rsquo;amor sull&rsquo; ali
rosee</i>&rdquo; followed immediately by the world-famous <i>Miserere</i> (&ldquo;<i>Ah, che
la morte ognora</i>&rdquo;), a choral chant asking pity and salvation from the
prisoners, all in the first scene of the fourth act; and the poignant duet
of Manrico and Azucena in the final scene, a fervent, glowing hope that
some day they can return to their beloved mountain country in peace
and love, &ldquo;<i>Ai nostri monti</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While <i>I Vespri siciliani</i>, or <i>Les V&ecirc;pres siciliennes</i> (<i>Sicilian Vespers</i>)
is one of Verdi&rsquo;s less familiar operas, its overture is one of his most successful.
The opera-libretto by Eug&egrave;ne Scribe and Charles Duveyrier&mdash;was
first performed at the Paris Op&eacute;ra on June 13, 1855. Its setting is
13th-century Sicily where the peasants rise in revolt against the occupying
French. The overture is constructed from some basic melodies
from the opera. The first <i>Allegro</i> theme speaks of the massacre of the
French garrison. A second melody&mdash;a beautiful lyrical passage <i>pianissimo</i>
against tremolos&mdash;is taken from the farewell scene of the hero and
the heroine who are about to die.</p>

<h2 id="c177"><span class="small">Richard <b id="g_Wagner">Wagner</b></span></h2>
<p>Wilhelm Richard Wagner, genius of the music
drama, was born in Leipzig, Germany, on May 22, 1813. In his academic
studies (at the Kreuzschule in Dresden, the Nikolaischule in Leipzig,
and the University of Leipzig) he was an indifferent, lazy, and irresponsible
student. But his intensity and seriousness of purpose where music
was concerned were evident from the beginning. He studied theory by
memorizing a textbook and then by receiving some formal instruction
from Theodor Weinlig. In short order he completed an overture and a
symphony that received performances between 1832 and 1833; in 1834
he completed his first opera, <i>Die Feen</i>, never performed in his lifetime.
In 1834 he was appointed conductor of the Magdeburg Opera where,
two years later, his second opera, <i>Das Liebesverbot</i>, was introduced. Between
1837 and 1838 he conducted opera in Riga. Involvement in debts
caused his dismissal from this post and compelled him to flee to Paris,
where he arrived in 1839. There he lived for three years in extreme
poverty, completing two important operas, <i>Rienzi</i> in 1840, and <i>The
Flying Dutchman</i> in 1841. His first major successes came with the first
of these operas, introduced at the Dresden Opera on October 20, 1842.
This triumph brought Wagner in 1843 an appointment as Kapellmeister
of the Dresden Opera which he held with considerable esteem
for six years. During this period he completed two more operas: <i>Tannhaeuser</i>,
introduced in Dresden in 1845, and <i>Lohengrin</i>, first performed
in Weimar under Liszt&rsquo;s direction, in 1850.</p>
<p>As a member of a radical political organization, the Vaterlandsverein,
Wagner became involved in the revolutionary movements that swept
across Europe in 1848-1849. To avoid arrest, he had to flee from
Saxony. He came to Weimar where he was warmly welcomed by Liszt
who from then on became one of his staunchest champions. After that
Wagner set up a permanent abode in Zurich. He now began to clarify
and expound his new theories on opera. He saw opera as a drama with
music, a synthesis of many arts; he was impatient with the old clich&eacute;s
and formulas to which opera had so long been enslaved, such as formal
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
ballets, recitatives and arias, production scenes, and so forth. And he
put his theories into practice with a monumental project embracing
four dramas, collectively entitled <i>The Nibelung Ring</i> (<i>Der Ring des
Nibelungen</i>) for which, as had always been his practice, he wrote the
text as well as the music; the four dramas were entitled <i>The Rhinegold</i>
(<i>Das Rheingold</i>), <i>The Valkyries</i> (<i>Die Walkuere</i>), <i>Siegfried</i>, and <i>The
Twilight of the Gods</i> (<i>Goetterdaemmerung</i>). It took him a quarter of a
century to complete this epic. But during this period he was able to
complete several other important music dramas, including <i>Tristan and
Isolde</i> in 1859 and <i>The Mastersingers</i> (<i>Die Meistersinger</i>) in 1867.</p>
<p>In 1862, Wagner was pardoned for his radical activities of 1849 and
permitted to return to Saxony. There he found a powerful patron in
Ludwig II, king of Bavaria, under whose auspices premi&egrave;res of Wagner&rsquo;s
mighty music dramas were given in Munich beginning with <i>Tristan
and Isolde</i> in 1865. In 1876 there came into being one of Wagner&rsquo;s
most cherished dreams, a festival theater built in Bayreuth, Bavaria,
according to his own specifications, where his music dramas could be
presented in the style and manner Wagner dictated. This festival
opened in August 1876 with the first performance anywhere of the
entire <i>Ring</i> cycle. Since then Bayreuth has been a shrine of Wagnerian
music drama to which music lovers of the world congregate during the
summer months. Wagner&rsquo;s last music drama was the religious consecrational
play, <i>Parsifal</i>, first performed in Bayreuth on July 26, 1882. Wagner
died in Venice on February 13, 1883, and was buried in the garden
of his home, Wahnfried, in Bayreuth.</p>
<p>Of his turbulent personal life which involved him in numerous and
often complex love affairs, mention need here be made only of his
relations with Cosima, daughter of Liszt, and wife of Hans von Buelow.
Wagner and Cosima fell in love while the latter was still von Buelow&rsquo;s
wife. They had two illegitimate children before they set up a home of
their own at Lake Lucerne; and one more (Siegfried) before they were
married on August 25, 1870.</p>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s creative career divides itself into two phases. In the first he
was the composer of operas in more or less a traditional style. To the
accepted formulas of operatic writing, however, he brought a new
dimension&mdash;immense musical and dramatic power and invention. In
the second phase he was the prophet of a new order in music, the creator
of the music drama. It is from the works of his first phase that salon or
pop orchestras derive selections that have become universal favorites&mdash;sometimes
overtures, sometimes excerpts. For these earlier works
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
abound with such a wonderful fund of melody, emotion, expressiveness
and dramatic interest that they have become popular even with those
operagoers to whose tastes the later Wagner is perhaps too subtle, complex,
elusive, or garrulous.</p>
<p>From <i>The Flying Dutchman</i> (<i>Der fliegende Hollaender</i>) comes a
dramatic overture. This opera&mdash;text by the composer based on an old
legend adapted by Heinrich Heine&mdash;was first performed at the Dresden
Opera on January 2, 1843. &ldquo;The Flying Dutchman&rdquo; is a ship on which
the Dutchman must sail until he achieves redemption through the love
of a faithful woman. Only once in every seven years is he permitted to
go ashore to find that love. He finally achieves his redemption through
Senta. They both meet their final doom together in a raging sea which
swallows up the ship.</p>
<p>Turbulent music, intended to describe a storm at sea, opens the overture.
We then hear the theme of the Dutchman in the horns and bassoons.
The stormy music returns and subsides as a motive from Senta&rsquo;s
beautiful second-act ballad, &ldquo;<i>Traft ihr das Schiff</i>&rdquo; is presented. This
motive brings up the image of Senta herself. A vigorous sailors&rsquo; chorus
is followed by a return of the Senta motive in full orchestra.</p>
<p>Three selections from <i>The Flying Dutchman</i> are of particular appeal:
Senta&rsquo;s spinning song, &ldquo;<i>Summ und brumm</i>&rdquo; and her famous ballad,
both from the second act; and the chorus of the sailors in the third
act, a rousing chantey, &ldquo;<i>Steuermann! lass die Wacht</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lohengrin</i> was Wagner&rsquo;s last &ldquo;opera.&rdquo; After that he confined himself
to music dramas. He completed it in 1848. After its premi&egrave;re in Weimar
on August 28, 1850 it became one of the most successful operas in Germany
of that period. The text, by the composer, was adapted from
medieval legends. Lohengrin is a knight of the Holy Grail who becomes
Elsa&rsquo;s champion against Telramund when Elsa is unjustly accused of
having murdered Gottfried. Lohengrin arrives on a swan and extracts
from Elsa the promise that she must never try to uncover his true identity.
After defeating Telramund, Lohengrin marries Elsa who, provoked
by Telramund&rsquo;s wife, cannot stifle her curiosity about her husband&rsquo;s
background and source. He finally must reveal to her that he is
a knight of the Holy Grail. Having made that revelation he must leave
her forever.</p>
<p>The two familiar orchestral preludes, from the first and third acts,
are opposites in mood, texture, and dynamics. The Prelude to Act 1
has spiritual content, a portrait of a heavenly vision wherein the Holy
Grail is carried by angels. The main theme is heard quietly in the upper
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
registers of the violins, then repeated by other instruments. This theme
is developed into a <i>crescendo</i> and culminates in an exultant statement
by trumpets and trombones. Now the theme is given in a <i>decrescendo</i>,
and the prelude ebbs away <i>pianissimo</i>, once again in the strings in the
upper register.</p>
<p>The Prelude to Act 3 is more robust in character, since it depicts the
joy of Elsa and Lohengrin on the eve of their wedding. A forceful melody
is pronounced by the full orchestra, succeeded by a second strong
theme for the cellos, horns, bassoons in unison; a march-like episode
for the wind instruments follows.</p>
<p>What is probably the most famous wedding march ever written comes
out of <i>Lohengrin</i>. Its strains are heard after the rise of the curtain for
Act 3, Scene 1, as a procession enters the bridal chamber. The chorus
hymns a blessing to the marriage couple (&ldquo;<i>Treulich gefuert</i>&rdquo;). From
one side ladies conduct Elsa, while from the other the King and his
men lead Lohengrin. The two processions then meet midstage and
Elsa joins Lohengrin to be blessed by the King. The two columns of
the procession then refile and march out of the two sides of the stage.</p>
<p><i>The Mastersingers</i> (<i>Die Meistersinger</i>), while written after Wagner
had set forth on his operatic revolution, is the only one of his music
dramas with a recognizable operatic ritual: big arias, huge production
numbers, even dances. For <i>The Mastersingers</i> is a comedy, the only
one Wagner ever wrote. For purposes of comedy some of the traditions
of opera still prove useful to Wagner, even if fused with techniques,
approaches and esthetics of the music drama. Wagner completed <i>The
Mastersingers</i> in 1867&mdash;eight years after <i>Tristan and Isolde</i> and more
than a decade following the first two dramas of the <i>Ring</i> cycle. The
first performance took place in Munich on June 21, 1868. The libretto,
by the composer, was set in Nuremberg in the middle 16th century, and
its plot revolves around a song contest conducted by the Mastersingers,
its winner to receive the hand of lovely Eva, daughter of the cobbler-philosopher,
Hans Sachs. Walther von Stolzing, a knight, and Beckmesser,
a contemptible town clerk, are the main rivals for Eva. At a
magnificent ceremony at the banks of the Pognitz River the contestants
sing their offerings. It is Walther&rsquo;s eloquent &ldquo;Prize Song&rdquo; that emerges
victorious.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Prize Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Morgenlich leuchtend</i>&rdquo;) is one of Wagner&rsquo;s most
famous melodies, the pivot upon which the entire opera gravitates. It is
first heard in the first scene of the third act, where Walther comes to tell
Hans Sachs of a song come to him in a dream. The song is repeated in
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
the closing scene of the opera during the actual contest. This &ldquo;Prize
Song&rdquo; is used by Wagner symbolically. Its victory over the dull and
stilted creation of Beckmesser represents the triumph of inspiration
and freedom of expression over hackneyed rules and procedures. August
Wilhelmj made a famous transcription of the &ldquo;Prize Song&rdquo; for
violin and piano.</p>
<p><i>Rienzi</i>, an early Wagner opera, is today remembered primarily for
its overture. But in its own day it was extremely popular. Immediately
after its premi&egrave;re performance in Dresden on October 20, 1842, <i>Rienzi</i>
made Wagner&rsquo;s name known throughout all of Germany for the first
time, appearing in the repertory of virtually every major German opera
house at the time. The novel from which the composer derived his
libretto is that of Bulwer-Lytton. The central character, Rienzi, is a
Roman ruler of the 14th century who meets his destruction at the hands
of his enemies who set the Capitol aflame in which Rienzi perishes.
Trumpet calls in the opening measures of the overture lead to a slow
section in which is prominent an affecting melody for strings, Rienzi&rsquo;s
prayer for the Roman people. In the main section of the overture, the
first main theme is the battle hymn of the first act (in the brass) set
against Rienzi&rsquo;s prayer-melody. The opening slow section returns and
is succeeded by the stirring music from the first act finale. In the coda,
the battle-hymn music is powerfully projected for the last time.</p>
<p><i>Tannhaeuser</i> boasts many popular selections beyond its very famous
overture. The opera was first performed in Dresden on October 19,
1845. The libretto is by the composer. Tannhaeuser is a minstrel-knight
who has grown weary of the carnal delights on the Hill of Venus
and longs for his own world. By invoking the name of the Virgin Mary,
in whom he places his trust, Tannhaeuser is transported to a valley near
the Wartburg Castle, where he is recognized and welcomed back by
Wolfram, a companion minstrel-knight. Joyously, Tannhaeuser returns
with Wolfram to the Hall of the Minstrels in the Wartburg Castle to
find that his beloved Elisabeth is still in love with him. But only he who
can come out triumphant in a song contest on the subject of love can
win Elisabeth. The song Tannhaeuser presents, glorifying sensual pleasure,
horrifies the audience. Contrite, Tannhaeuser offers to atone for
his sins by joining pilgrims to Rome and seeking absolution from the
Pope. Elisabeth promises to pray for his soul. After several months have
passed, Elisabeth is awaiting the return of the Roman pilgrims, and
Wolfram beseeches heaven to guide Elisabeth and protect her. Suddenly
Tannhaeuser&mdash;haggard and decrepit&mdash;makes his appearance. He confesses
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
to Wolfram that his soul will not be redeemed until the staff in
the Pope&rsquo;s hands sprouts leaves. Only after Elisabeth has died of grief
in despair of ever seeing Tannhaeuser again, do the tidings come from
Rome that the Pope&rsquo;s staff has, indeed, blossomed with foliage.</p>
<p>The Overture is built from some of the principal melodies of the
opera; in a sense it traces the main events of the story. The religious
chant of the Pilgrims (in clarinets, bassoons and horns) is heard at once.
This is followed by music suggesting Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s repentance, a
touching melody for strings. After both these ideas have been discussed
we hear in the strings the voluptuous music of Venusberg, a picture of
the carnal life led by Tannhaeuser with Venus on Venus Hill. The
music is brought to a compelling climax with a loud statement of Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s
passionate hymn to carnal love with which he so horrified the
minstrel-knights at Wartburg Castle. The chant of the pilgrims, which
had opened the overture, also brings it to conclusion.</p>
<p>The Prelude to Act 3 is solemn music that bears the title, &ldquo;Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s
Pilgrimage.&rdquo; Two themes are set forth at once, that of Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s
repentance, and that suggesting Elisabeth&rsquo;s intercession.
Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s suffering is then portrayed by a poignant melody for
strings. Suggestions of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s Chorus and a motive known as
&ldquo;Heavenly Grace&rdquo; are then offered. The prelude ends quietly and
sensitively, as Tannhaeuser at long last achieves salvation.</p>
<p>The sensual, even lascivious, music of the <i>Bacchanale</i> in the opening
scene (recreating the revelry enjoyed by Tannhaeuser and Venus
on Venus Hill) is often performed in conjunction with the Overture,
sometimes independently. Another orchestral episode extremely popular
is the stately <i>March</i> of the second act with which the minstrel-knights
of the Wartburg file into the Castle, followed by the nobles,
ladies, and attendants, as they chant the strains of &ldquo;<i>Freudig begruessen
wir die edle Halle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most popular vocal excerpt from <i>Tannhaeuser</i> is Wolfram&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ode to the Evening Star&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>O du mein holder Abendstern</i>&rdquo;) in the last
act. This atmospheric music, a hymn to the mystery and beauty of the
night, is Wolfram&rsquo;s prayer to the evening star that it guide and protect
Elisabeth. Elisabeth&rsquo;s second-act song of praise to the Hall of Wartburg
Castle in which she speaks of her joy in learning of Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s return
(&ldquo;<i>Dich, teure Halle</i>&rdquo;) and her eloquent third-act prayer for Tannhaeuser&rsquo;s
forgiveness (&ldquo;<i>Allmaecht&rsquo;ge Jungfrau</i>&rdquo;) are also deservedly
celebrated for their affecting lyricism.</p>
<p>Wagner did not write much music not intended for the stage. Of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">338</span>
meager repertory one or two items deserve attention in the semi-classical
repertory. One is &ldquo;<i>Traeume</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Dreams&rdquo;) a song often heard in
transcriptions, particularly for orchestra. This is one of five poems by
Mathilde Wesendonck which Wagner set to music in 1857-1858, and it
appears as the last song of the cycle. This gentle nocturne derives some
of its melody from the famous love-duet of the second act of <i>Tristan
and Isolde</i> (&ldquo;<i>O sink hernieder, Nacht der Liebe</i>&rdquo;) but the overall effect
of the song is one of gentle revery rather than sensual love. Wagner
himself arranged &ldquo;<i>Traeume</i>&rdquo; for small orchestra. On Mathilde Wesendonck&rsquo;s
birthday on December 23, 1857, he conducted eighteen musicians
in a performance of the song under Mathilde&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>The <i>Kaiser March</i> was another of Wagner&rsquo;s compositions not intended
for the stage. He wrote it in 1871 to celebrate Germany&rsquo;s victory
over France. A proud, exultant theme is first offered by the full
orchestra. A transition in the brasses and timpani brings on a second
theme of contrasting character in the woodwind. There follows a brief
statement of Martin Luther&rsquo;s famous chorale, &ldquo;<i>Ein feste Burg</i>.&rdquo; After
dramatic music depicting the fever of battle, the Luther chorale is repeated
triumphantly by the brasses. The first theme returns loudly in
full orchestra after a fanfare to end the march.</p>
<h2 id="c178"><span class="small">Emil <b id="g_Waldteufel">Waldteufel</b></span></h2>
<p>Emil Waldteufel, waltz-king of France, was born in
Strasbourg on December 9, 1837. His father, a professor of music at
the Strasbourg Conservatory, gave him his first music instruction. After
that Emil attended the Paris Conservatory, but he never completed his
course of study there, leaving the schoolroom to take on a job with a
piano manufacturer. He published his first waltzes at his own expense
in 1860, <i>Joies et peines</i> and <i>Manola</i>. The latter so enchanted the Prince
of Wales that he willingly accepted the dedication of Waldteufel&rsquo;s next
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
waltz, <i>Bien aim&eacute;</i>, a fact that played no small part in establishing Waldteufel&rsquo;s
reputation in England. Waldteufel now decided to sidestep all
other activities to concentrate on the writing of waltz music. In short
order he became the idol of Paris in the same way that Johann Strauss II
was of Vienna. For a period, Waldteufel&rsquo;s fame throughout Europe was
second only to that of the Viennese waltz king. Waldteufel made many
tours of the European capitals conducting his own compositions, scoring
triumphs in Covent Garden in 1885, and in Berlin in 1889. In 1865
he became chamber musician to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie and director of
the court balls. He died in Paris on February 16, 1915.</p>
<p>Waldteufel published over 250 waltzes. A comparison with Johann
Strauss is perhaps inevitable. The French waltz king never equalled
Strauss&rsquo; remarkable melodic invention, original approaches in harmony
and orchestration, and overall inspiration. Most of Waldteufel&rsquo;s waltzes
are functional pieces, and make far better dance music than concert
music. But a handful of his waltzes are classics, and deservedly so. They
are buoyant and inviting in their spirit, aristocratic in style, spontaneous
in expression. Waldteufel&rsquo;s most famous waltzes include the following:
<i>Espa&ntilde;a</i>, op. 236, which utilizes for its waltz melodies the basic
themes from Chabrier&rsquo;s rhapsody of the same name; and <i>The Skaters</i>
(<i>Les Patineurs</i>), op. 183, in which the main elegant melody has the
lightness of foot and the mobility of motion of facile figure skaters.
Other popular Waldteufel waltzes include the <i>Acclamations</i>, op. 223;
<i>Dolores</i>, op. 170; <i>Estudiantina</i>, op. 191; <i>Mon r&ecirc;ve</i>, op. 151; <i>Les Sir&egrave;nes</i>,
op. 154; <i>Toujours ou jamais</i>, op. 156; and <i>Violettes</i>, op. 148.</p>
<h2 id="c179"><span class="small">Karl Maria von <b id="g_Weber">Weber</b></span></h2>
<p>Karl Maria von Weber was born in Eutin, Oldenburg,
Germany, on November 18, 1786. His father, who played the
violin in small theaters, was determined to make his son a musical
prodigy, subjecting him from childhood on to severe discipline, and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
intensive study with Karl&rsquo;s stepbrother, J. P. Heuschkel and Michael
Haydn. Weber made public appearances as pianist in early boyhood.
His first opera was written when he was only thirteen, and at fourteen
his second opera was performed in Chemnitz, Freiberg, and Vienna. An
even more comprehensive period of study than heretofore followed in
Munich with Abb&eacute; Vogler. After that, in 1804, Weber was appointed
conductor of the Breslau City Theater. In 1806 he became Musik Intendant
to the Duke of Wuerttemberg, and in 1807 private secretary
and music master to Duke Ludwig in Stuttgart. From 1813 to 1816 he
was the music director of German Opera in Prague and in 1817 musical
director of German Opera in Dresden. It was in this last post that he
created the first of his unqualified masterworks, the opera <i>Der Freischuetz</i>,
introduced with phenomenal success in Berlin on June 18,
1821. It was with this work that German Romantic opera was born,
grounded in Germanic nationalism, filled with the German love for the
legendary and the supernatural, and characterized by its use of German
landscapes and backgrounds. Weber wrote two more masterworks with
which his high station in opera was solidified: <i>Euryanthe</i>, introduced in
Vienna on October 25, 1823, and <i>Oberon</i>, first heard in London, on
April 12, 1826. In London, attending the premi&egrave;re of the latter opera,
Weber succumbed to his last sickness on June 5, 1826. His body was
transferred to Dresden where it was buried to special ceremonies at
which Wagner delivered the eulogy.</p>
<p>Weber&rsquo;s monumental contributions to opera in general, and German
opera, in particular, do not fall within the scope of this volume; neither
do the three masterworks with which he gained immortality. In music
in a lighter vein he was most significant for being one of the first to
create waltz music within an extended structure. The most popular of
these compositions was the <i>Invitation to the Dance</i> (<i>Aufforderung zum
Tanz</i>), written in 1819 as a &ldquo;rondo brilliant&rdquo; in D-flat major, for piano
solo. It has since become celebrated in several orchestral transcriptions,
notably those by Berlioz and Felix Weingartner. This work is one of
the first in music history in which several different waltz tunes are combined
into a single cohesive composition, preceded by an introduction
and concluding with an epilogue. The introduction consists of a subdued,
well-mannered melody, simulating the request to a lady by a
young man for a dance, and the acceptance. Several waltz melodies follow,
to which this couple dance. The epilogue consists of a return of the
introduction, this time with the gentleman thanking the lady for having
danced with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>The <i>Jubilee Overture</i> (<i>Jubel</i>), op. 59, for orchestra is another of
Weber&rsquo;s more popular creations, this time in a stirring style. He wrote
it in 1818 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the ascension to
the throne by the King of Saxony. A slow introduction leads to the
main body of the overture in which the main theme is forcefully stated
by the full orchestra. By contrast there later appears a light-hearted
tune, soon given considerable prominence in the development section.
When both ideas have been repeated, a climax is reached with a statement
of the English anthem, &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo; in the wind instruments
accompanied by the strings.</p>
<h2 id="c180"><span class="small">Kurt <b id="g_Weill">Weill</b></span></h2>
<p>Kurt Weill was born in Dessau, Germany, on March 2, 1900.
A comprehensive musical training took place first with private teachers
in Dessau, then at the Berlin High School of Music, and finally for
three years with Ferruccio Busoni. Weill started out as a composer of
avant-garde music performed at several important German festivals.
His first opera, <i>The Protagonist</i>, with a text by Georg Kaiser, was produced
in 1926. From this point on Weill continued writing operas in
which the texts were realistic or satiric, and the music filled with popular
idioms, sometimes even those of jazz. The most important were <i>The
Royal Palace</i> in 1927; <i>The Three-Penny Opera</i>, a sensation when first
produced in 1928; <i>The Czar Has Himself Photographed</i>, also in 1928;
and <i>The Rise and Fall of Mahagonny</i>, in 1930, one of whose numbers,
&ldquo;The Alabamy Song,&rdquo; was a leading song hit in Germany that year.
With these works Weill became one of the leading exponents of the
cultural movements then sweeping across Germany under the banners
of <i>Zeitkunst</i> (Contemporary Art) and <i>Gebrauchsmusik</i> (Functional
Music). In the fall of 1935, Weill established permanent residence in
the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1943. He soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
assumed a position of first importance in the Broadway theater by virtue
of a succession of outstanding musicals: <i>Johnny Johnson</i> (1936);
<i>Knickerbocker Holiday</i> (1938) in which Walter Huston starred as Peter
Stuyvesant and out of which came one of Weill&rsquo;s most popular musical
numbers, &ldquo;September Song&rdquo;; Moss Hart&rsquo;s musical about psychoanalysis
and the dream life, <i>Lady in the Dark</i> (1941) in which Gertrude Lawrence
was starred; <i>One Touch of Venus</i> (1943), with Mary Martin;
<i>Street Scene</i> (1947), a trenchant musical play based on Elmer Rice&rsquo;s
realistic drama of New York; <i>Love Life</i> (1948), book and lyrics by Alan
Jay Lerner, its main musical number being another all-time Weill song
favorite, &ldquo;Green-Up Time&rdquo;; and <i>Lost in the Stars</i> (1949), a powerful
musical drama adapted from Alon Paton&rsquo;s novel, <i>Cry, the Beloved
Country</i>. Weill died in New York City on April 3, 1950.</p>
<p><i>The Three-Penny Opera</i> (<i>Die Dreigroschenoper</i>) is one of the most
important musical productions of the post-World War I era in Europe;
and since its premiere it has lost little of its initial popularity. This
musical play (or opera, if you will) was based on the historic 18th-century
ballad opera of John Gay, <i>The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</i>. The text was rewritten
and modernized by Berthold Brecht, in whose hands the comic
opera became a brilliant, though often bitter, satire of Germany in the
late 1920&rsquo;s, with penetrating satirical comments on crime and corruption
in this post-war era. Weill&rsquo;s opera was introduced in Berlin on
August 31, 1928 and scored a sensation with few parallels in contemporary
German theater. Over one hundred theaters gave it four thousand
performances throughout Germany in its initial year. It was made
into a motion-picture by G. W. Pabst (the first of several screen adaptations).
It was introduced in the leading theatrical centers of the world;
the American premi&egrave;re&mdash;in New York on April 13, 1933&mdash;was, however,
a dismal failure. It has since been revived frequently in all parts of the
civilized world. An off-Broadway presentation in 1954&mdash;with a new
modernized text by Marc Blitzstein, but with the Weill music untouched&mdash;made
history by accumulating a run of more than five years;
a national company was then formed to tour the country in 1960. During
this long Broadway run, the principal musical number, &ldquo;Moritat&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;Mack the Knife&rdquo;) became an American hit song on two different
occasions. In 1955 it was given over twenty different recordings and was
often represented on the Hit Parade; revived in 1959 by Bobby Darin,
it sold over a million discs.</p>
<p>Weill&rsquo;s score is a mixture of opera and musical comedy, of European
stage traditions and American idioms. It opens with a blues and concludes
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
with a mock chorale, while in between these opposite poles there
can be heard a shimmy, a canon in fox-trot, popular tunes, formal ballads,
light airs, choruses, and ensemble numbers. The style ranges
freely from Tin Pan Alley clich&eacute;s to atonality, from mock romanticism
to dissonance. Each number was basic to the plot; principal numbers
often became penetrating psychological commentaries on the characters
who presented them. &ldquo;Moritat&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Mack the Knife&rdquo;) is the main
musical number. But several others are also of outstanding interest
including &ldquo;Love Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Liebeslied</i>&rdquo;), &ldquo;The Ballad of Pleasant Living&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>Ballade vom angenehmen Leben</i>&rdquo;), the Canon-Song, <i>Barbarasong</i>,
and the Bully&rsquo;s Ballad (&ldquo;<i>Zuhaelterballade</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<h2 id="c181"><span class="small">Jaromir <b id="g_Weinberger">Weinberger</b></span></h2>
<p>Jaromir Weinberger was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia,
on January 8, 1896. After completing his music study at the
Prague Conservatory, and privately with Max Reger in Berlin, he came
to the United States in 1922, teaching for one season at the Ithaca Conservatory
in Ithaca, New York. Following his return to Europe he held
various posts as teacher and conductor. He achieved international renown
as a composer with a Bohemian folk opera, <i>Schwanda, der Dudelsackpfeifer</i>
first performed in Prague on April 27, 1927, then successfully
heard throughout Europe and in the United States. Weinberger
wrote many operas after that, and a considerable amount of orchestral
music. Up to 1937 his home was in Prague, but since 1939 he has lived
in the United States. One of his most successful works for orchestra was
introduced in the United States soon after his arrival, <i>Under the
Spreading Chestnut Tree</i>.</p>
<p>Among the numerous works by Weinberger are two that can be said
to have a more popular appeal than the others. One is in an American
idiom and manner which Weinberger assumed for many of his major
<span class="pb" id="Page_344">344</span>
works after coming to this country; the other is in the Bohemian style
with which he first became famous.</p>
<p>That in the American style and spirit (but technically in a fugue
idiom) is a delightful treatment of the popular American tune by Dan
Emmett, &ldquo;Dixie.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; had originated as a minstrel-show tune, being
written by Emmett as a &ldquo;walk-around&rdquo; (or closing number) for a
minstrel-show production at the Bryant Theater in New York in November
1859. It became an immediate favorite with minstrel troupes
throughout the country. During the Civil War it became the Southland&rsquo;s
favorite battle hymn, despite the fact that it was the work of a
Northerner. The charge at Gettysburg by General George Pickett was
made to the strains of this music. After the surrender at Appomattox,
President Lincoln invited a band outside the White House to play the
tune for him maintaining that since the North had conquered the
Southern army it had also gained its favorite song as a spoils of war. In
1940 Weinberger wrote the <i>Prelude and Fugue on Dixie</i> for symphony
orchestra. The prelude devotes itself to a simple statement of the melody,
after which comes the lively fugal treatment of its main theme.
The treatment is throughout so skilful and musical that we never feel
any sense of contradiction in the use of a popular minstrel-show tune
within a soundly classical structure and through soundly classical
means.</p>
<p>Out of the composer&rsquo;s most famous opera, <i>Schwanda, der Dudelsackpfeifer</i>
(<i>Schwanda, the Bagpipeplayer</i>) comes a <i>Polka and Fugue</i> for
orchestra that is undoubtedly the most familiar excerpt from the opera.
The vivacious <i>Polka</i>&mdash;which has a lusty peasant vitality in its marked
accentuations&mdash;comes from Act 2, Scene 2; the fugue (whose main
theme is suggested in the polka) is used in the opera&rsquo;s closing scene. Just
before the end of the fugue, the polka melody is heard again, set contrapuntally
against the fugue tune in a powerful climax in which the
full orchestra, as well as an organ, is utilized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">345</div>
<h2 id="c182"><span class="small">Henri <b id="g_Wieniawski">Wieniawski</b></span></h2>
<p>Henri Wieniawski was born in Lublin, Poland, on July
10, 1835. When he was eight he entered the Paris Conservatory, from
which he was graduated three years later with first prize in violin-playing,
the first time this institution conferred such an honor on one so
young. Sensational appearances as child prodigy followed throughout
Europe. After an additional period of study at the Paris Conservatory
between 1849 and 1850, he initiated his career as a mature performer,
and as one of the world&rsquo;s foremost violinists, with performances in
Europe and Russia. In 1872 he toured the United States with the
pianist, Anton Rubinstein. Meanwhile, in 1859, he was appointed solo
violinist to the Czar of Russia, and from 1862 to 1867 he was professor
of the violin at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. In 1874 he succeeded
Vieuxtemps as professor of the violin at the Brussels Conservatory
where he remained fourteen years. He suffered a heart attack while
performing in Berlin in 1878, and died in Moscow on March 31, 1880.</p>
<p>Wieniawski produced a rich repertory of music for the violin which
is still performed extensively. This includes the famous Concerto in
D minor and many smaller compositions. Among the latter can be
found pieces which have become favorites with salon orchestra in transcription.
These, like other major works by the composer, are characterized
by broad and expressive melodies and brilliant technical effects.</p>
<p>The <i>Kujawiak</i>, in A minor, op. 3 is a brilliant rhythmic number&mdash;a
spirited mazurka which derives its name from the fact that it has come
out of the Kuawy district of Poland. The <i>L&eacute;gende</i>, op. 17, on the other
hand, is outstanding for its sentimental lyricism. This piece is an eloquent
song, originally for violin and orchestra, that seems to be telling
a romantic tale. The <i>Polonaise brillante</i>, in D major, op. 4, like the
<i>Kujawiak</i>, is a successful attempt to incorporate within a concert work
the characteristics of a popular Polish dance. This composition is
appealing for its sharp accentuations on the half beat, syncopations,
and brilliant passage work. The <i>Souvenirs of Moscow</i> (<i>Souvenirs de
Moscou</i>), op. 6, is a fantasia on famous Russian airs, the most important
of which is &ldquo;The Red Sarafin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">346</div>
<h2 id="c183"><span class="small">Ralph <b id="g_VaughanWilliams">Vaughan Williams</b></span></h2>
<p>Ralph Vaughan Williams was born in Down
Ampney, England, on October 12, 1872. After attending the Royal
College of Music, he studied composition privately with Max Bruch in
Berlin. In 1901 he was appointed organist of the St. Barnabas Church
in London. For the next few years he devoted himself mainly to
church music. His interest in the English folk songs of the Tudor
period, first stimulated in 1904, proved for him a decisive turning point.
Besides dedicating himself henceforth to intensive research in English
folk music (much of which he helped to revive from neglect and obscurity
through his editions and adaptations) he found a new direction
as composer: in the writing of music with a national identity, music
absorbing the melodic, harmonic and modal techniques&mdash;at times even
the actual material&mdash;of these old songs and dances. This new trend first
became evident in 1907 with his <i>Norfolk Rhapsodies</i>. After an additional
period of study with Maurice Ravel in Paris, Vaughan Williams
embarked upon the writing of his first major works which included the
famous <i>Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</i>, <i>London Symphony</i>,
and the opera <i>Hugh the Drover</i>. Subsequent works in all fields of composition
placed him with the masters of 20th-century music. These
compositions included symphonies, operas, concertos, fantasias, choral
and chamber music. For more than thirty years, Vaughan Williams
taught composition at the Royal College of Music in London; from
1920 to 1928 he was the conductor of the Bach Choir, also in that city.
He paid two visits to the United States, the first time in 1922 to direct
some of his works at a music festival in Connecticut, and the second
time a decade later to lecture at Bryn Mawr College. He received the
Order of Merit in 1935 and the Albert medal of the Royal Society of
Arts in 1955. He died in London on August 26, 1958.</p>
<p>Only a meagre number of Vaughan Williams&rsquo; compositions have
popular appeal. One of these is the <i>Fantasia on Greensleeves</i>, for orchestra.
&ldquo;Greensleeves&rdquo; is an old English folk song dating from the early
16th century, and mentioned in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>The Merry Wives of</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
<i>Windsor</i>. In the 17th century it became the party song of the Cavaliers.
Americans know it best through a popular-song adaptation in 1957.
Vaughan Williams&rsquo; delightful fantasia appears as an orchestral interlude
in his opera <i>Sir John in Love</i> (1929), based on <i>The Merry Wives of
Windsor</i>. A brief episode for flute leads to &ldquo;Greensleeves,&rdquo; which is
harmonized opulently for strings. Two brief variations follow. Then
the opening flute episode is recalled as is the folk song itself&mdash;the main
melody in lower strings with embellishments in the upper ones.</p>
<p><i>The March of the Kitchen Utensils</i> is an amusing little episode for
orchestra, part of the incidental music prepared by the composer for
a production of Aristophanes&rsquo; <i>The Wasps</i> in Cambridge in 1909. This
march opens with a humorous little theme for the wind instruments in
the impish style of Prokofiev. The theme is taken over by the strings.
The middle section is much more in the identifiable national style of
Vaughan Williams with a melody that resembles an old English folk
dance.</p>
<h2 id="c184"><span class="small">Jacques <b id="g_Wolfe">Wolfe</b></span></h2>
<p>Jacques Wolfe, composer of songs in the style of Negro
Spirituals familiar in the repertory of most American baritones, was
born in Botoshan, Rumania on April 29, 1896. He was trained as a
pianist at the Institute of Musical Art. While serving in the army during
World War I, a member of the 50th Infantry Band, he was stationed
in North Carolina where he first came into contact with Negro folk
songs. This made such a profound impression on him that he devoted
himself to research in this field. After the war he made many appearances
on the concert stage both as a solo performer and as an accompanist.
For several years he was also a teacher of music at New York
City high schools.</p>
<p>Wolfe&rsquo;s two best known songs in the style of Negro folk songs appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
in 1928. One is &ldquo;De Glory Road,&rdquo; words by Clement Wood, a
work of such extraordinary fervor and dramatic character that it has
proved a sure-fire number with concert baritones throughout the
country, and notably with Lawrence Tibbett with whom it was a particular
favorite. The other was &ldquo;Short&rsquo;nin&rsquo; Bread,&rdquo; to Wolfe&rsquo;s own
words. The latter in all probability is not original with Wolfe but an
adaptation of one of the melodies he discovered in North Carolina.
Several Negro composers have been credited with being its composer;
one of them was Reese d&rsquo;Pres who is said to have written the melody
in or about 1905.</p>
<p>Among Wolfe&rsquo;s other familiar songs are &ldquo;God&rsquo;s World,&rdquo; &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to
Hebb&rsquo;n&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallelujah Rhythm.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c185"><span class="small">Ermanno <b id="g_WolfFerrari">Wolf-Ferrari</b></span></h2>
<p>Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari was born in Venice, Italy,
on January 12, 1876. Originally planning to make art his career he went
to Rome, but while there became so fascinated by opera that then and
there he decided to become a musician. He completed his musical training
in Munich in 1895 with Josef Rheinberger. In 1899 he returned to
his native city where his first major work&mdash;an oratorio, <i>La Sulamite</i>&mdash;was
successfully performed. His first opera, <i>Cenerentola</i> (<i>Cinderella</i>)
was introduced in Venice in 1900. His first comic opera (or opera buffa)
came to Munich in 1903: <i>Le Donne Curiose</i>. He achieved world renown
with still another comic opera, <i>The Secret of Suzanne</i>, first performed
in Munich in 1909. This distinguished achievement was followed
by an equally significant achievement in a serious vein, the
grand opera, <i>The Jewels of the Madonna</i>, first heard in Berlin in 1911.
One year later Wolf-Ferrari paid his first visit to the United States to
attend in Chicago the American premi&egrave;re of <i>The Jewels of the Madonna</i>.
He wrote many operas after that, both in a comic and serious
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
style, but his fame still rests securely on <i>The Secret of Suzanne</i> and <i>The
Jewels of the Madonna</i>. From 1902 to 1912 he was director of the
Benedetto Marcello Conservatory in Venice. He died in that city on
January 21, 1948.</p>
<p>From <i>The Jewels of the Madonna</i> (<i>I Gioielli della Madonna</i>) have
come several familiar orchestral episodes. This tragedy&mdash;libretto by the
composer with verses by Carlo Zangarini and Enrico Golisciani&mdash;was
successfully introduced in Berlin on December 23, 1911. Rafaele, leader
of the Camorrists, and Gennaro, a blacksmith, are rivals for the love of
Maliela. After Rafaele appears to have won Maliela&rsquo;s love, Gennaro
wins her away from his rival by stealing for her the jewels decorating
the image of the Madonna. Maliela confesses to Rafaele and other
Camorrists about this theft, then rushes off into a raging sea to meet her
death. After Gennaro has returned the jewels to the Madonna, he
plunges a dagger into his own breast.</p>
<p>Two melodious intermezzos for orchestra are often played by salon
and pop orchestras. The first comes between the first and second acts
and is in a languorous mood. The second, heard between the second and
third acts, opens with a light subject and continues with a broadly
lyrical episode. A third popular orchestral excerpt from this opera is the
dramatic &ldquo;Dance of the Camorristi&rdquo; during a revel in the Camorristi
hideout in the opening of the third act.</p>
<p>As an opera <i>The Secret of Suzanne</i> (<i>Il Segreto di Susanna</i>) is a trifle.
The libretto by Enrico Golisciani concerns a terrible secret harbored
by the heroine, Suzanne: she is addicted to smoking. Since her husband
finds cigarette butts in their house he suspects her of entertaining a
lover during his absence. Spying on her through the window, one day,
he learns about his wife&rsquo;s secret to his infinite relief, and does not hesitate
to join her in a smoke. Light, breezy, infectious, and unpretentious,
this little opera has been a favorite with operagoers everywhere since
its world premi&egrave;re in Munich on December 4, 1909.</p>
<p>The overture is as gay and as capricious as this merry tale. It begins
vivaciously with the main theme in first violins and the woodwind.
After this idea has been elaborated upon, a second melody is heard in
the flute and clarinet accompanied by strings. The two melodies are
soon merged contrapuntally, with the first theme heard in woodwinds
and trumpet and the second in the strings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_350">350</div>
<h2 id="c186"><span class="small">Sebasti&aacute;n <b id="g_Yradier">Yradier</b></span></h2>
<p>Sebasti&aacute;n Yradier was born in Sauciego, &Aacute;lava, Spain
on January 20, 1809. Little is known of his career beyond the fact that
his music instruction took place with private teachers; that in 1851 he
was appointed singing master to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie in Paris; and that
for a period he lived in Cuba. He died in Vitoria, Spain, on December
6, 1865. He was a successful composer of Spanish songs. The most
famous is &ldquo;<i>La Paloma</i>,&rdquo; which is in the habanera rhythm, its melody in
the sensual, sinuous style of a flamenco song. &ldquo;<i>El Arreglito</i>,&rdquo; also a
habanera, was borrowed by Bizet for his opera <i>Carmen</i> where it re-emerges
as the world-famous &ldquo;Habanera&rdquo;; Bizet made only minor
changes in the melody while retaining Yradier&rsquo;s tonality and accompaniment.
A third popular Yradier song, in a style similar to &ldquo;<i>La Paloma</i>,&rdquo;
is &ldquo;<i>Ay Chiquita!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c187"><span class="small">Carl <b id="g_Zeller">Zeller</b></span></h2>
<p>Carl Zeller was born in St. Peter-in-der-Au, Austria on July
19, 1842. Music, the study of which he had pursued since boyhood with
private teachers, was an avocation. He earned his living as an official in
the Ministry of Education in Austria. Nevertheless, he managed to
write many operettas, two of which were among the most successful
written in Austria during his time. Among his first works for the stage
were <i>Joconde</i> (1876), <i>Die Carbonari</i> (1880), and <i>Der Vagabund</i> (1886).
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
His first major success came with <i>Der Vogelhaendler</i> in 1886, still a
great favorite on the Continent. The second of his operetta classics,
<i>Der Obersteiger</i>, was introduced in 1894. A later successful, though less
well known, operetta, <i>Der Kellermeister</i>, was produced posthumously
in 1901. Zeller died in Baden near Vienna on August 17, 1898.</p>
<p><i>Der Obersteiger</i> (<i>The Master Miner</i>)&mdash;book by M. West and L. Held&mdash;received
its premi&egrave;re in Vienna on January 5, 1894. The setting is a
salt-mining district of Austria in or about 1840. Martin instigates a
strike among the miners, for which he is deprived of his job. To support
himself he organizes a band of musicians from among the miners
and tours the country. Eventually Martin returns to his mining town
where he finally manages to regain his job and to win Nelly, with
whom he has always been in love. The most popular song in the operetta
is Martin&rsquo;s air with chorus, &ldquo;<i>Wo sie war, die Muellerin</i>,&rdquo; and its
most delightful waltz is &ldquo;<i>Trauet nie dem blossen schein</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Der Vogelhaendler</i> (<i>The Bird-Seller</i>), once again with a book by
M. West and L. Held, was first heard in Vienna on January 10, 1891;
but in 1933 it was presented in a new version in Munich adapted by
Quedenfelt, Brugmann and Bauckner. In the Rhine Palatinate in the
18th century, Adam, a wandering bird-seller, is in love with Christel,
but she refuses to consider marriage unless he gets a permanent job.
He gets that job on the estate of the Elector Palatine at which point
Christel is all too willing to give up a projected marriage with Count
Stanislaus for the sake of her beloved Adam. The lovable melodies from
this operetta&mdash;in the best traditions of Supp&eacute; and Johann Strauss II&mdash;have
made it a favorite not only in Germany and Austria, but also
throughout the rest of Europe, in North and South America, and in
South Africa. Among the musical highlights of this operetta are the
waltz &ldquo;<i>Schau mir nur recht ins Gesicht</i>&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Nightingale Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Wie
mein Ahn&rsquo;l zwanzig Jahr</i>&rdquo;); the pert march tune &ldquo;<i>Kaempfe nie mit
Frau&rsquo;n</i>&rdquo;; and Christel&rsquo;s sprightly air, &ldquo;<i>Ich bin die Christel von der
Post</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">352</div>
<h2 id="c188"><span class="small">Karl Michael <b id="g_Ziehrer">Ziehrer</b></span></h2>
<p>Karl Michael Ziehrer, beloved Viennese composer
of waltzes and operettas, was born in Vienna on May 2, 1843. He was
completely self-taught in music. In 1863 he formed a caf&eacute;-house orchestra
with which he toured Austria and Germany, often featuring his
own dance pieces and marches. He later expanded this orchestra into
an ensemble numbering fifty players with which he gave a series of successful
concerts of semi-classical music in Vienna. In 1907 he became
music director of the court balls. After World War I he suffered extreme
poverty, his personal fortune having been lost with the collapse
of the Hapsburg monarchy. He died in want and obscurity in Vienna
on November 14, 1922.</p>
<p>Ziehrer wrote more than five hundred popular pieces for orchestra,
including numerous marches and waltzes. His waltzes were particularly
favored, many of these in the style of Johann Strauss II. Some are still
extensively played. Probably the most famous of all his waltzes is
Wiener Maedchen (&ldquo;Vienna Maidens&rdquo;), which must rank with Leh&aacute;r&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Merry Widow Waltz&rdquo; as one of the most popular such dances produced
in Vienna since the time of Johann Strauss II. Its first melody
sounds like a Schubert Laendler, with the peasant vigor of its rhythm
and its robust tune; but the main subject is a soaring waltz in the finest
traditions of Viennese caf&eacute;-house music. The following are other
famous Ziehrer waltzes: &ldquo;<i>Alt Wien</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Old Vienna&rdquo;), &ldquo;<i>Faschingskinder</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Carnival Children&rdquo;), and &ldquo;<i>Wiener Buerger</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Viennese Citizens&rdquo;),
all three of which come closest among his works in assuming the structural
outlines and the melodic identity of the Johann Strauss waltz
classics. Also popular are the &ldquo;<i>Donauwalzer</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Waltzes from the Danube&rdquo;)
and &ldquo;<i>Evatochter</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Daughter of Eve&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Ziehrer&rsquo;s most famous operetta is <i>Die Landestreicher</i> (<i>The Vagabonds</i>)&mdash;book
by L. Krenn and C. Lindau, first performed in Vienna on
July 26, 1899. In upper Bavaria two tramps&mdash;Fliederbusch and his wife
Bertha&mdash;manage to live by their wits. Disguised respectively as Prince
Gilka and a dancer they visit a famous resort hotel and are involved in
<span class="pb" id="Page_353">353</span>
numerous adventures. By managing to retrieve a supposedly valuable
lost necklace for the Prince they finally win his favor and enter his
service. Of particular interest is the captivating waltz at the end of the
first act, &ldquo;<i>Sei gepriesen, du lauschige Nacht</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From several of Ziehrer&rsquo;s other operettas there come other delightful
waltzes, notably &ldquo;<i>Samt und Seide</i>&rdquo; from <i>Der Fremdenfuehrer</i> (1902)
and &ldquo;<i>Hereinspaziert</i>&rdquo; from <i>Der Schatzmeister</i> (1904).</p>

<br />LIGHTER CLASSICS
<br />IN MUSIC</h3>
<p class="center">by DAVID EWEN</p>
<p>In one brilliant volume, David Ewen
offers a classic in musical literature. Here
are the treasured semi-classical works of
two continents&mdash;enduring, always alive&mdash;analyzed
by a famed authority, acclaimed
as &ldquo;music&rsquo;s interpreter to the American
people.&rdquo; A must for the music lover <span class="smaller">THE
LIGHTER CLASSICS IN MUSIC</span> is the first
reference book of its kind in any language.</p>
<p>Here is the music of Victor Herbert,
Eric Coates, Jacques Offenbach, Johann
Strauss and Franz Leh&aacute;r. This is the music
of the salon, caf&eacute;-house, pop concert, and
operetta theatre.</p>
<p><span class="smaller">THE LIGHTER CLASSICS IN MUSIC</span> is also
the story of the spontaneity and creative
invention of popular contemporary composers;
Duke Ellington (&ldquo;Black, Brown,
and Beige&rdquo;), Morton Gould (&ldquo;Yankee
Doodle Went To Town&rdquo;), George Gershwin.
These favorites are universally loved;
their long life-span is assured.</p>
<p>There is still a third story&mdash;a story of
the genius of classical masters who have
produced works whose popular interest
and subtle freshness compels an immediate
emotional impact. Beethoven,
Mozart, Haydn, Brahms, Chopin, Schubert&mdash;all
have brought forth wonderlands
of sound to delight the senses.</p>
<p>The author needs no introduction to
music afficionados. <span class="smaller">MUSIC FOR MILLIONS</span>
went through six printings in as many
years. A revised, up-dated edition, <span class="smaller">EWEN&rsquo;S
MUSICAL MASTERWORKS</span>, was soon demanded
and brought about. On the whimsical
side, illustrator A. Birnbaum and
Mr. Ewen put their heads together and
came up with <span class="smaller">LISTEN TO THE MOCKING
WORDS</span>, a medley of anecdotes about
music and musicians.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Ewen turns a brilliant musical
literacy and easy, non-pompous style
exclusively to the lighter classics. Here are
the lives of 187 composers; over 1000
perceptive analyses of musical masterpieces
in the lighter style prefaced by
biographical sketches. An easy-to-use alphabetical
listing of the lighter classics
makes it easy to get the specific information
you need.</p>
<p><span class="smaller">THE LIGHTER CLASSICS IN MUSIC</span> is an
enduring book to be cherished by the concertgoer,
record collector, musician, instructor,
historian&mdash;all music lovers who
know the universal sounds of music in the
lighter style.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
